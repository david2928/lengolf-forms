# Staff Scheduling Formatting Rules

## IMPORTANT: DO NOT REVERT THESE FORMATTING CHANGES

The staff scheduling interface has been optimized for compact display. These changes should NOT be reverted:

### Staff Weekly Hours Section
- Grid: `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-6` (6 columns on large screens)
- Padding: `p-2` (compact padding)
- Text: Shortened status text ("Under", "Over", "Good" instead of full words)
- Layout: Center-aligned compact cards

### Weekly Calendar Grid
- Container padding: `p-3 sm:p-4` (compact)
- Grid gaps: `gap-2 md:gap-3` (smaller gaps)
- Day containers: `min-h-[80px] md:min-h-[100px]` (reduced height)
- Schedule items: `p-1` (compact padding)
- Coverage indicators: `w-1.5 h-1.5` (smaller dots)
- Recurring indicators: `w-3 h-3` (smaller icons)

### Removed Elements
- Staff Color Legend section has been completely removed
- Debug buttons have been removed

## Why These Changes Were Made
1. **Space Efficiency**: More information visible without scrolling
2. **Better UX**: Reduced visual clutter
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Better responsive behavior
4. **User Request**: Specifically requested by user to shrink boxes and remove legend

## If Changes Get Reverted
If these formatting changes get automatically reverted, check:
1. IDE auto-formatting settings
2. Git stash or version control restoration
3. Browser cache (hard refresh required)
4. Auto-save features restoring old versions
