# Playwright Testing Scheme Requirements

## Introduction

The Playwright Testing Scheme provides comprehensive end-to-end testing coverage for the staff scheduling system using Playwright's browser automation framework. The testing scheme will validate critical user workflows, ensure cross-browser compatibility, and provide reliable regression testing for both staff and admin interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Staff Schedule Viewing Workflows

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated tests for staff schedule viewing workflows, so that I can ensure the mobile interface works correctly across different devices and browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running staff schedule tests THEN the system SHALL test staff name selection from the landing page
2. WHEN testing personal schedule view THEN the system SHALL verify horizontal date picker navigation and shift display
3. WHEN testing team schedule view THEN the system SHALL validate "Everyone" mode showing all staff schedules
4. WHEN testing shift details THEN the system SHALL verify modal opening, content display, and time clock integration
5. WHEN testing mobile responsiveness THEN the system SHALL validate touch interactions and responsive layouts

### Requirement 2: Admin Schedule Management Workflows

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated tests for admin schedule management workflows, so that I can ensure the desktop interface functions correctly for schedule creation and editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running admin tests THEN the system SHALL test schedule creation with form validation
2. WHEN testing schedule editing THEN the system SHALL verify existing schedule modification workflows
3. WHEN testing schedule deletion THEN the system SHALL validate confirmation dialogs and data removal
4. WHEN testing recurring schedules THEN the system SHALL verify weekly pattern creation and editing
5. WHEN testing conflict detection THEN the system SHALL validate scheduling conflict warnings and prevention

### Requirement 3: Cross-Browser and Device Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want tests to run across multiple browsers and device configurations, so that I can ensure compatibility across the user base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running cross-browser tests THEN the system SHALL execute on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
2. WHEN testing mobile devices THEN the system SHALL simulate iPhone, Android, and tablet viewports
3. WHEN testing desktop interfaces THEN the system SHALL validate on different screen resolutions
4. WHEN running responsive tests THEN the system SHALL verify layout adaptation across viewport sizes
5. WHEN testing touch interactions THEN the system SHALL validate swipe gestures and tap targets

### Requirement 4: API Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want tests that validate API interactions and data flow, so that I can ensure backend integration works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing schedule retrieval THEN the system SHALL verify API responses and data formatting
2. WHEN testing schedule creation THEN the system SHALL validate POST requests and database updates
3. WHEN testing schedule updates THEN the system SHALL verify PUT requests and data persistence
4. WHEN testing schedule deletion THEN the system SHALL validate DELETE requests and data removal
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want tests that validate access control and security measures, so that I can ensure proper user permissions are enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing staff access THEN the system SHALL verify staff can access schedule viewing but not admin functions
2. WHEN testing admin access THEN the system SHALL verify admins can access both staff and admin interfaces
3. WHEN testing unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL verify proper redirects and access denial
4. WHEN testing session management THEN the system SHALL validate login persistence and timeout handling
5. WHEN testing route protection THEN the system SHALL verify middleware-based access control

### Requirement 6: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want tests that validate system performance under various load conditions, so that I can ensure the system performs well in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure page load times and API response times
2. WHEN testing concurrent users THEN the system SHALL validate system behavior with multiple simultaneous sessions
3. WHEN testing data loading THEN the system SHALL verify schedule data loads within acceptable time limits
4. WHEN testing mobile performance THEN the system SHALL validate touch response times and smooth animations
5. WHEN testing database queries THEN the system SHALL verify query performance meets established benchmarks

### Requirement 7: Visual Regression Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated visual regression tests, so that I can detect unintended UI changes and maintain consistent visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running visual tests THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots of key interface states
2. WHEN comparing visual changes THEN the system SHALL detect pixel-level differences in UI components
3. WHEN testing responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL verify visual consistency across viewport sizes
4. WHEN testing color coding THEN the system SHALL validate shift color assignments and visual indicators
5. WHEN testing modal displays THEN the system SHALL verify overlay positioning and content layout

### Requirement 8: Data-Driven Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want tests that use realistic test data scenarios, so that I can validate system behavior with various data configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running data-driven tests THEN the system SHALL use multiple staff configurations and schedule patterns
2. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL validate behavior with empty schedules, conflicts, and boundary conditions
3. WHEN testing date scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify behavior across different weeks, months, and time zones
4. WHEN testing recurring patterns THEN the system SHALL validate various weekly schedule configurations
5. WHEN testing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL verify system behavior with large datasets

### Requirement 9: Test Reporting and CI Integration

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive test reporting and CI integration, so that I can track test results and integrate testing into the development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed HTML reports with screenshots and videos
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture failure screenshots and provide detailed error information
3. WHEN integrating with CI THEN the system SHALL run tests automatically on code changes
4. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on test coverage and execution time
5. WHEN tests run in CI THEN the system SHALL fail builds on critical test failures

### Requirement 10: Test Maintenance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want maintainable and scalable test architecture, so that I can easily add new tests and maintain existing ones as the system evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL use page object model pattern for maintainable test structure
2. WHEN adding new tests THEN the system SHALL provide reusable components and helper functions
3. WHEN updating tests THEN the system SHALL minimize maintenance overhead through good abstraction
4. WHEN scaling tests THEN the system SHALL support parallel execution and efficient resource usage
5. WHEN debugging tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging capabilities
