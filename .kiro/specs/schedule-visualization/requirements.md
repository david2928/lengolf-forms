# Schedule Visualization Requirements

## Introduction

The Schedule Visualization feature adds a read-only visual timeline display to the admin staff-scheduling page. This section provides administrators with an intuitive hourly view of staff coverage, showing staff schedules as colored blocks spanning their working hours. The visualization complements the existing editable schedule grid by offering a clear overview of daily staffing patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Timeline Layout

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see a visual timeline of staff schedules below the existing schedule grid, so that I can quickly understand daily staffing coverage at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin staff-scheduling page THEN the system SHALL display a visual timeline section below the existing editable schedule grid
2. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN it SHALL show columns for each day of the week (Monday through Sunday)
3. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN it SHALL show rows for each business hour from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM
4. WHEN the timeline loads THEN it SHALL use the same data source as the existing editable schedule grid
5. WHEN the timeline is displayed THEN it SHALL be clearly labeled as a "Coverage Overview" or similar heading

### Requirement 2: Staff Schedule Blocks

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see staff schedules displayed as colored blocks spanning their working hours, so that I can visualize coverage gaps and overlaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff member has a scheduled shift THEN the system SHALL display a colored block spanning the hours they are working
2. WHEN displaying a schedule block THEN it SHALL show the staff member's name in a tab at the top of the block
3. WHEN displaying schedule blocks THEN they SHALL use the same colors as the existing staff schedule system
4. WHEN a staff member works multiple non-consecutive shifts in one day THEN the system SHALL display separate blocks for each shift
5. WHEN multiple staff members work overlapping hours THEN their blocks SHALL be displayed side by side within the same time slots

### Requirement 3: Color Consistency

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the visualization to use the same staff colors as the existing schedule system, so that I can easily identify staff members across both interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying staff schedule blocks THEN the system SHALL use the exact same color scheme as the existing editable schedule grid
2. WHEN a staff member's color is updated in the main system THEN the visualization SHALL automatically reflect the color change
3. WHEN displaying staff names on blocks THEN the text SHALL have sufficient contrast against the background color for readability
4. WHEN staff members are inactive or unavailable THEN their blocks SHALL use appropriate visual indicators (such as reduced opacity)

### Requirement 4: Time Grid Structure

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the timeline to show clear hour markers and day divisions, so that I can easily identify specific times and days when viewing coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN each hour from 10:00 AM to 11:00 PM SHALL be clearly marked with time labels
2. WHEN displaying the timeline THEN each day column SHALL be clearly labeled with the day name
3. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN hour rows SHALL have alternating background colors or subtle grid lines for easy reading
4. WHEN displaying time labels THEN they SHALL use 12-hour format (10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, etc.)
5. WHEN the timeline spans multiple days THEN day boundaries SHALL be visually distinct

### Requirement 5: Read-Only Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the visualization section to be completely read-only, so that I can view coverage without accidentally modifying schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with the visualization THEN no schedule blocks SHALL be clickable or editable
2. WHEN hovering over schedule blocks THEN the system SHALL NOT display edit controls or modification options
3. WHEN viewing the visualization THEN there SHALL be no add, delete, or modify buttons within this section
4. WHEN the visualization is displayed THEN it SHALL clearly indicate that it is a "View Only" section
5. WHEN administrators want to make changes THEN they SHALL use the existing editable schedule grid above the visualization

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As an administrator using different screen sizes, I want the visualization to adapt appropriately to my display, so that I can view schedules effectively on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop screens THEN the visualization SHALL display all days and hours in a full grid layout
2. WHEN viewing on smaller screens THEN the visualization SHALL maintain readability by adjusting font sizes and block dimensions
3. WHEN the visualization doesn't fit the screen width THEN it SHALL provide horizontal scrolling while keeping time labels visible
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the visualization SHALL stack or compress appropriately while remaining functional
5. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the visualization SHALL adapt smoothly without losing data or functionality

### Requirement 7: Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the visualization to automatically update when I make changes to the schedule grid above, so that I can immediately see the impact of my scheduling decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a schedule is added in the editable grid THEN the visualization SHALL immediately display the new schedule block
2. WHEN a schedule is modified in the editable grid THEN the visualization SHALL update the corresponding block in real-time
3. WHEN a schedule is deleted in the editable grid THEN the visualization SHALL remove the corresponding block immediately
4. WHEN the page loads THEN both the editable grid and visualization SHALL display the same schedule data
5. WHEN there are data conflicts THEN the system SHALL prioritize the editable grid data and update the visualization accordingly

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an administrator viewing complex schedules, I want the visualization to load quickly and perform smoothly, so that it doesn't slow down my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visualization loads THEN it SHALL render within 2 seconds even with full weekly schedules for all staff
2. WHEN displaying many overlapping shifts THEN the visualization SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and interaction
3. WHEN the schedule data updates THEN only the affected blocks SHALL re-render to maintain performance
4. WHEN viewing the visualization THEN it SHALL not impact the performance of the editable schedule grid above
5. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the visualization SHALL adapt quickly without noticeable lag

### Requirement 9: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As an administrator with accessibility needs, I want the visualization to be accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation, so that I can effectively use the scheduling system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the visualization SHALL provide meaningful descriptions of schedule blocks and time slots
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN users SHALL be able to focus on and read schedule information
3. WHEN displaying staff names THEN they SHALL have sufficient color contrast against their background blocks
4. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN time and day labels SHALL be properly associated with their corresponding data
