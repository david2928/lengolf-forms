## ‚úÖ What We've Verified (All Good!)

- ‚úÖ Dev server is running on port 3000
- ‚úÖ Server is listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- ‚úÖ Firewall rule is created and enabled
- ‚úÖ Firewall rule applies to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
- ‚úÖ Your PC network is set to "Private" profile
- ‚úÖ Server responds on PC at: http://192.168.1.196:3000
- ‚úÖ curl test successful (HTTP 200 OK)

## üî¥ Things to Check on Your Phone

### 1. WiFi Network Name - CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Your PC is connected to:** `nala_5G`

**On your phone:**
- Go to WiFi settings
- Check the EXACT network name
- Must be: **`nala_5G`** (exact match, case-sensitive)
- NOT: `nala` or `nala_2.4G` or any other network

**Common Issue:** Many routers have multiple networks:
- `nala_5G` (5GHz band)
- `nala` or `nala_2.4G` (2.4GHz band)

Both devices MUST be on the same network name!

### 2. Double-Check the URL

**Correct URL:** `http://192.168.1.196:3000`

Make sure you typed:
- ‚úÖ `http://` (not `https://`)
- ‚úÖ `192.168.1.196` (check each digit)
- ‚úÖ `:3000` (colon and port)
- ‚ùå No trailing slash needed
- ‚ùå No spaces

### 3. Phone Browser Settings

**Try Different Browser:**
- Safari (iOS) - try in regular mode
- Chrome (Android/iOS) - try in regular mode
- Disable any VPN or ad blockers temporarily

**Clear Browser:**
- Clear browser cache
- Try in private/incognito mode

### 4. Phone WiFi Issues

**Verify Internet Works:**
- Open any website (google.com) on phone
- Make sure WiFi is actually working
- Not just connected, but actively has internet

**Restart WiFi:**
- Turn OFF WiFi on phone
- Wait 5 seconds
- Turn ON WiFi
- Reconnect to `nala_5G`
- Try URL again

### 5. Phone VPN/Security Apps

**Disable temporarily:**
- VPN apps
- Security apps (Norton, McAfee, etc.)
- Ad blockers
- DNS changers (like 1.1.1.1)
- Private DNS/Secure DNS settings

### 6. Router Settings (Advanced)

**AP Isolation / Client Isolation:**
- Some routers have "AP Isolation" or "Client Isolation" enabled
- This prevents devices on WiFi from seeing each other
- You'll need to log into your router and disable it
- Usually found under WiFi settings or Security settings

**Guest Network:**
- Make sure you're NOT on a guest network
- Guest networks often block device-to-device communication

## üß™ Quick Tests

### Test 1: Can you ping from phone?

**On Android (requires terminal app):**
```bash
ping 192.168.1.196
```

**On iOS:**
- Download "Network Analyzer" app
- Use ping tool to ping 192.168.1.196

If ping fails, devices can't see each other (likely AP Isolation or wrong network).

### Test 2: Try from another device

**If you have another device (laptop, tablet, etc.):**
1. Connect it to `nala_5G`
2. Open browser
3. Go to: `http://192.168.1.196:3000`
4. Does it work?

If YES: Problem is specific to your phone
If NO: Problem is network configuration (AP Isolation likely)

### Test 3: Try on PC's browser

**On your PC, open browser and navigate to:**
- `http://192.168.1.196:3000`

Does it work on PC?
- YES: PC can access it, so server and firewall are fine
- NO: Something wrong with PC configuration

## üîß Solutions by Symptom

### Symptom: "This site can't be reached" or "Can't connect to server"

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. **Wrong WiFi network** - Double-check network name
2. **AP Isolation enabled** - Check router settings
3. **Phone firewall/security app** - Disable temporarily
4. **VPN active on phone** - Disable temporarily

### Symptom: Page loads forever (spinning)

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. **Firewall partially blocking** - Try disabling Windows Firewall completely as a test
2. **Request reaching server but response blocked** - Check antivirus

### Symptom: "Connection refused"

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. **Dev server not running** - Check if `npm run dev:mobile` is still running
2. **Wrong port** - Make sure it's `:3000` not `:3001` or something else

## üéØ Step-by-Step Diagnostic

Try these in order:

**Step 1: Verify WiFi Network**
```
PC Network: nala_5G
Phone Network: _________ (write it down)
Are they IDENTICAL? Yes / No
```

**Step 2: Test URL on PC Browser**
```
URL: http://192.168.1.196:3000
Works on PC? Yes / No
```

**Step 3: Restart Phone WiFi**
```
1. Turn OFF WiFi
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Turn ON WiFi
4. Connect to nala_5G
5. Try URL again
Works now? Yes / No
```

**Step 4: Try Incognito Mode**
```
Open phone browser in incognito/private mode
Go to: http://192.168.1.196:3000
Works now? Yes / No
```

**Step 5: Disable Phone VPN/Security**
```
Any VPN running? Yes / No
Disabled? Yes / No
Try URL again
Works now? Yes / No
```

**Step 6: Check Router AP Isolation**
```
Log into router: http://192.168.1.1 (usually)
Find AP Isolation / Client Isolation setting
Is it enabled? Yes / No / Can't find
```

## üö® If Nothing Works

**Last Resort Options:**

### Option A: Disable AP Isolation
1. Log into router (usually http://192.168.1.1)
2. Username/password (check router sticker)
3. Find WiFi ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí AP Isolation
4. Disable it
5. Save and restart router

### Option B: Use ngrok (Temporary Tunnel)
```bash
# Install ngrok
# Then run:
ngrok http 3000

# Use the https URL it provides on your phone
# This bypasses local network completely
```

### Option C: USB Debugging (Android Only)
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on phone
# Connect phone via USB
# PC Chrome: chrome://inspect#devices
# Test through remote debugging
```
