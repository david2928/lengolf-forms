## 🚀 Setup Instructions (REQUIRED)

### ⚠️ Step 0: Request Google My Business API Access (CRITICAL)

**The Google My Business API requires formal approval from Google before use.**

1. **Submit Access Request Form:**
   - URL: https://support.google.com/business/contact/api_default
   - Select: "Application for Basic API Access"
   - Project Number: `1071951248692`
   - Email: Use `info@len.golf` (must be Business Profile owner/manager)
   - Use Case: "Internal backoffice system to manage and respond to Google reviews"

2. **Wait for Approval:**
   - Processing time: Up to 14 days
   - You'll receive an email when approved
   - Once approved, the `mybusiness.googleapis.com` API will be available to enable

3. **After Approval:**
   - Run: `gcloud services enable mybusiness.googleapis.com`
   - Or enable via console at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/mybusiness.googleapis.com/overview?project=1071951248692

**Note:** The feature is fully built and ready. It will work immediately once API access is approved.

### Step 1: Enable Google APIs

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=lengolf-forms)

2. Search for and enable these APIs:
   - ✅ **My Business Business Information API** (already enabled)
   - ✅ **My Business Account Management API** (already enabled)

3. **Check Quotas** (after enabling):
   - Go to: APIs & Services > My Business Business Information API > Quotas
   - If quota shows 0, you may need to request access
   - Most business owners get automatic access for their own locations

### Step 2: Run Database Migration

Option A - Using Supabase CLI:
```bash
cd C:\vs_code\lengolf-forms-feature\lengolf-forms
supabase db push
```

Option B - Manual (Supabase Dashboard):
1. Go to https://bisimqmtxjsptehhqpeg.supabase.co
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20260105120000_create_google_reviews_table.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

### Step 3: Connect Google Business Account

**IMPORTANT:** This system uses a separate OAuth flow (not your regular login).

1. Navigate to: **`/admin/google-reviews`**

2. You'll see a connection status banner:
   - If disconnected: Orange banner with "Connect Google Business" button
   - If connected: Green banner showing connected email

3. Click **"Connect Google Business"** button

4. Sign in with `info@len.golf` (or the Google account that manages your Business Profile)

5. Grant permissions:
   - ✅ "Manage your business information on Google"
   - Click "Allow"

6. You'll be redirected back with a success message

**Note:** This connection is stored separately and doesn't affect your admin login.

### Step 4: Test the Feature

1. After connecting, the **"Sync Reviews"** button will become active

2. Click **"Sync Reviews"** to fetch from Google

3. You should see:
   - Loading indicator during sync
   - Success message: "Sync completed! X new, Y updated, Z total"
   - Reviews appearing in the table/cards
   - Stats updating automatically

4. Try the features:
   - Filter by reply status
   - Click any review to see full details
   - Test on mobile (card-based layout)

## 📊 How to Use

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin/google-reviews`)

**Features:**
- **Stats Cards:** Total reviews, average rating, replied vs. pending
- **Filters:** All | Has Reply | Needs Reply
- **Sync Button:** Fetches latest reviews from Google
- **Reviews Table:** Shows reviewer, rating, comment, language, status, date

**Workflow:**
1. Click "Sync Reviews" to fetch from Google (can run anytime)
2. Use filters to view specific review types
3. See which reviews need replies (orange "Pending" badge)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Google Business account not connected"

**Cause:** No OAuth tokens stored in database

**Solution:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/google-reviews`
2. Click "Connect Google Business" button
3. Sign in with `info@len.golf` account
4. Grant the required permissions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch reviews: 403 Forbidden"

**Cause:** API not enabled or account doesn't have permission

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Google My Business API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
2. Check that `info@len.golf` is a Manager/Owner of the LENGOLF Business Profile
3. Confirm OAuth tokens are stored (check connection status)
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Issue: Sync button is disabled

**Cause:** Google Business account not connected

**Solution:**
- Check connection status banner at top of page
- Click "Connect Google Business" if showing as disconnected

### Issue: Quota is 0 after enabling API

**Cause:** Google requires manual approval for some accounts

**Solution:**
- Contact Google via their GBP API access request form
- Mention you're accessing reviews for your own business location
- Usually approved within 2-3 business days

### Issue: Reviews not appearing after sync

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database migration ran successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM backoffice.google_reviews LIMIT 1;
   ```
3. Check API logs in Vercel/deployment platform

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow (Separate from User Login)
```
Admin clicks "Connect Google Business"
  ↓
Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
  ↓
User signs in with info@len.golf
  ↓
Google returns authorization code
  ↓
exchangeCodeForTokens() [src/lib/google-business-oauth.ts]
  ↓
Tokens stored in backoffice.google_business_oauth table
  ↓
Auto-refresh logic keeps tokens valid
```

### Review Sync Flow
```
Admin clicks "Sync Reviews"
  ↓
getValidAccessToken() [src/lib/google-business-oauth.ts]
  - Fetches token from database
  - Auto-refreshes if expired
  ↓
fetchAllReviews(accessToken) [src/lib/google-business-profile.ts]
  - Calls Google Business Profile API v4
  - Paginated fetching (50 per page)
  ↓
syncReviewsToSupabase(accessToken)
  - Upserts reviews to backoffice.google_reviews
  - Updates existing reviews if changed
  ↓
Success response with counts (new, updated, total)
  ↓
Admin UI refreshes and displays reviews
```

### OAuth Scopes Required
- `openid` - User identification
- `email` - User email
- `profile` - User profile info
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage` - Read/write business info

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Separate OAuth Flow:** Keeps business profile access independent from user authentication
2. **Dedicated Account:** Uses `info@len.golf` to ensure consistent access
3. **Token Storage:** Database storage enables server-side token refresh
4. **Direct REST API:** Uses fetch() instead of googleapis library for better control

## ⏳ Phase 2: Reply Posting (NOT STARTED)

### Overview

Phase 2 will allow admins to post replies to Google reviews directly from the backoffice. This can be done either:
1. **Option A:** Manual replies only (simpler, faster to implement)
2. **Option B:** AI-assisted replies with approval workflow (more complex, better UX)

### Current Limitations

**What's Already Available:**
- ✅ OAuth tokens with `business.manage` scope (needed for posting)
- ✅ View existing replies synced from Google
- ✅ Identify which reviews need replies (orange "Pending" badge)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ UI to compose/edit reply text
- ❌ API endpoint to post reply to Google
- ❌ Confirmation workflow before posting
- ❌ Error handling for failed posts
- ❌ (Optional) AI reply generation

---

## 🔧 Phase 2 Implementation Options

### Option A: Manual Reply Posting (Recommended First Step)

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation (2-3 hours)
- No AI dependencies
- Full control over reply content
- Can be enhanced with AI later

**What to Build:**

#### 1. UI Components (No Database Changes Needed)
- Add "Reply" button to review detail modal
- Add textarea for composing reply
- Add "Post Reply" confirmation dialog
- Show posting status (loading, success, error)

#### 2. API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/google-reviews/[id]/reply/route.ts` (NEW)

```typescript
POST /api/google-reviews/{review_id}/reply
Body: { reply_text: string }

Flow:
1. Get review from database
2. Get valid access token
3. POST to Google Business Profile API:
   PUT accounts/{account}/locations/{location}/reviews/{review}/reply
4. Update local database with reply
5. Return success/error
```

#### 3. Google API Integration
**Add to:** `src/lib/google-business-profile.ts`

```typescript
export async function postReviewReply(
  reviewName: string,
  replyText: string,
  accessToken: string
): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string }> {
  // POST to Google API
  // Update database if successful
}
```

---

### Option B: AI-Assisted Reply Generation (Future Enhancement)

**Additional Requirements:**
- OpenAI API integration
- Reply approval workflow
- Database table to track suggestions
- More complex UI

**Database Addition:**
**File:** `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDD_google_review_replies.sql` (NOT YET CREATED)

```sql
CREATE TABLE backoffice.google_review_replies (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  review_id UUID REFERENCES backoffice.google_reviews(id),
  suggested_reply TEXT,  -- AI-generated suggestion
  final_reply TEXT NOT NULL,  -- What was actually posted
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft',  -- draft, posted, failed
  posted_by TEXT,  -- admin user email
  posted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  post_error TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 2. AI Reply Generation Service
**File:** `src/lib/ai/google-review-reply-generator.ts` (NOT YET CREATED)

**Purpose:** Generate contextual replies based on review content

**Features:**
- Use OpenAI API to generate replies
- Style based on existing LENGOLF reply patterns:
  - Short & friendly (1-2 sentences)
  - Include reviewer's name
  - Golf emojis (⛳️ 🏌️)
  - Invitation to return
  - Thai replies for Thai reviewers (with คุณ prefix)

**Example Patterns from Existing Replies:**
- "Thanks for coming [Name]! Please come back again soon! ⛳️"
- "Loved having you [Name]! Your long drive records will be tough to beat! ⛳️"
- "Thank you คุณ [Name] - glad you had a great time! Please come back soon!"

#### 3. UI Enhancements for AI
- "Generate AI Reply" button in review detail modal
- Edit/approve workflow before posting
- Show AI confidence score (optional)
- Bulk generate for multiple reviews

#### 4. Additional API Routes for AI
**File:** `app/api/google-reviews/[id]/suggest/route.ts` (NOT YET CREATED)

```typescript
POST /api/google-reviews/{review_id}/suggest
Response: { suggested_reply: string }

// Uses OpenAI to generate reply based on:
// - Review rating
// - Review comment
// - Reviewer language (EN/TH)
// - Reviewer name
```
