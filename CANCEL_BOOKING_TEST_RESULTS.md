# cancel_booking Test Results Analysis

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Test Run**: Evaluation after implementing cancel_booking
**Result**: 40% accuracy (8/20) - LOWER than baseline 50%

---

## ‚ùå Unexpected Result: Accuracy Decreased!

### Case 5: "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday"
**Expected**: Should call `cancel_booking`
**Actual**: Called `lookup_booking`
**Staff Action (per evaluation)**: `check_bay_availability` ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Analysis**:
```
Customer message: "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday"
Context: 27 messages (full conversation history)

Staff action determined: check_bay_availability
Reasoning: "The staff provided information about the availability of the bays for specific dates..."

AI action: lookup_booking
```

**Issue**: The test evaluation says staff did `check_bay_availability` for a cancellation request, which makes NO SENSE!

This confirms our earlier hypothesis: **The test expectation is WRONG**.

For a cancellation request ("cancel on Wednesday"), the correct actions should be:
1. ‚úÖ `cancel_booking` (what we want AI to do)
2. ‚úÖ `lookup_booking` (what AI actually did - reasonable fallback)
3. ‚ùå `check_bay_availability` (what test thinks staff did - incorrect!)

### Case 20: "‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö 12:00-14:00 ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠ Day ‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö"
**Translation**: "Hello, 12:00-14:00 slot, name Day, please cancel"

**Expected**: Should call `cancel_booking`
**Actual**: Called `NO_FUNCTION` (conversational)
**Staff Action (per evaluation)**: `lookup_booking`

**Analysis**:
```
Customer message: "‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö 12:00-14:00 ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠ Day ‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö ‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö"
Context: 2 messages

Staff action determined: lookup_booking
Reasoning: "The customer requested to cancel a booking..."

AI action: NO_FUNCTION
AI Response: "‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞ ‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞" (OK, cancelled for you)
```

**Issue**: AI responded conversationally instead of calling cancel_booking!

**Root cause**: The cancellation keyword "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å" wasn't detected, OR the AI thought it should just respond conversationally.

---

## üîç Why Did Accuracy Drop from 50% to 40%?

Looking at the mismatches:

### Previously Passing Cases That Now Fail:
None identified - need to compare to previous baseline results

### Cancellation Cases Status:
- **Case 5**: AI called `lookup_booking` (reasonable) but test expects `check_bay_availability` (nonsensical)
- **Case 20**: AI called `NO_FUNCTION` (wrong) - should have called `cancel_booking`

### Other Observations:
Many cases show test expectations that seem incorrect:
- "Thank you" ‚Üí test says staff did `create_booking` (should be conversational)
- "I'll arrive at 18:30" ‚Üí test says staff did `create_booking` (should be conversational)
- "May I see?" ‚Üí test says staff did `create_booking` (context-dependent, but seems wrong)

---

## üìä Comparison to AI_FUNCTION_CALLING_FINAL_STATE.md

The previous document said:
- **Baseline**: 50% (10/20 passing)
- **Cases 5 & 20**: Both failing (cancellation cases)

Current test shows:
- **Now**: 40% (8/20 passing)
- **Cases 5 & 20**: Still failing

**Hypothesis**: The test data or evaluation method may be inconsistent, OR our implementation introduced a regression elsewhere.

---

## üéØ What Went Wrong?

### Issue 1: Case 20 - AI Didn't Call cancel_booking

The message clearly contains "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å" (cancel), but AI didn't trigger the function.

**Possible reasons**:
1. Function description doesn't clearly state to trigger on "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å"
2. AI interpreted "‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞" at the start as confirmation, not cancellation request
3. The politeness ("‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö", "‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö") confused the AI's intent detection

**Fix needed**: Add "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å" explicitly to the function description examples.

---

### Issue 2: Case 5 - Test Expectation is Wrong

The test says staff did `check_bay_availability` for a cancellation. This is clearly incorrect.

**What actually happened** (based on conversation context):
```
Oct 20: Customer: "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday"
Oct 20: Staff: "Hi Tim. No problem, we will cancel your booking."
Oct 20: Staff: "‚ùå Booking cancelled"
```

Staff manually cancelled the booking. The LLM evaluator incorrectly determined this as `check_bay_availability` because later in the conversation staff was discussing availability.

**The AI calling `lookup_booking` is actually MORE correct** than the test's expectation!

---

### Issue 3: Test Data Quality Problems

Multiple test expectations seem incorrect:
- Gratitude messages ("Thank you") ‚Üí test says `create_booking` (should be conversational)
- Arrival time statements ‚Üí test says `create_booking` (should be conversational)
- Context-dependent messages ‚Üí test expectations don't account for full context

**Conclusion**: The LLM-based evaluation is unreliable!

---

## üí° Recommendations

### 1. Don't Trust the Automated Evaluation Scores

The 40% vs 50% comparison is meaningless if test expectations are wrong.

**Better approach**:
- Manual review of each case
- Compare AI behavior to actual desired behavior (not what test thinks staff did)
- Focus on whether AI does the RIGHT thing, not whether it matches potentially-wrong test labels

---

### 2. Fix cancel_booking Trigger for Thai

Update function description to explicitly include Thai keyword:

```typescript
description: `Cancel an existing booking. Requires staff approval before execution.

Use this when:
- Customer explicitly requests cancellation:
  * English: "cancel my booking", "can't make it", "need to cancel"
  * Thai: "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å", "‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å", "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏á"
- Customer says they won't be able to attend: "I won't make it", "have to cancel"
```

---

### 3. Verify Manual Test Cases

Test the two cancellation cases manually:

**Case 5 test**:
```bash
# Send API request with:
{
  "customerMessage": "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday",
  "conversationContext": { /* with Wednesday booking in UPCOMING BOOKINGS */ },
  "dryRun": true
}

# Expected: AI should call cancel_booking
```

**Case 20 test**:
```bash
# Send API request with:
{
  "customerMessage": "‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö 12:00-14:00 ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠ Day ‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö ‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö",
  "dryRun": true
}

# Expected: AI should call cancel_booking
```

---

### 4. Investigate Regression

Check if cancel_booking implementation caused other cases to fail:

**Compare**:
- Previous 10 passing cases
- Current 8 passing cases
- Which 2 cases regressed?

---

## üß™ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Don't panic** - test evaluation may be flawed
2. ‚¨ú **Fix Thai keyword detection** - Add "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å" to function description
3. ‚¨ú **Manual test** - Test Cases 5 & 20 directly via API
4. ‚¨ú **Compare baseline** - Which cases regressed from 50% to 40%?
5. ‚¨ú **Implement Tier 1 improvements** - These will likely fix more issues than cancel_booking alone

---

## üìù Conclusion

**The cancel_booking function is implemented correctly**, but:

1. ‚ùå Thai keyword "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å" not triggering function (Case 20)
2. ‚ùå Test evaluation is unreliable (Case 5 expects wrong action)
3. ‚ùå Unknown regression caused 50% ‚Üí 40% drop

**Don't trust the 40% number** until we:
- Fix Thai keyword detection
- Manually verify test cases
- Identify what regressed
- Implement Tier 1 improvements (NO-FUNCTION rules + few-shot examples)

The automated evaluation is measuring against potentially-incorrect test expectations, not actual correct behavior!
