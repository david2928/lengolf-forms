# cancel_booking Function - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and Ready for Testing

---

## üìã Summary

Successfully implemented a complete `cancel_booking` function for the AI assistant, addressing 20% of failing test cases (Cases 5 & 20).

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Function Schema (`src/lib/ai/function-schemas.ts`)

Added new function schema:
```typescript
{
  name: 'cancel_booking',
  description: `Cancel an existing booking. Requires staff approval before execution.`
  // Full schema with all parameters and validation rules
}
```

**Parameters**:
- `booking_id` - Preferred way to identify booking
- `date` - Alternative if booking_id not available
- `customer_name` - For searching bookings
- `phone_number` - For searching bookings
- `cancellation_reason` - Optional reason text
- `staff_name` - For audit trail (defaults to "AI Assistant")

**When AI calls this**:
- Customer says "cancel my booking", "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å", "can't make it"
- Customer explicitly requests cancellation
- After confirming booking details from UPCOMING BOOKINGS or lookup_booking

---

### 2. Function Executor (`src/lib/ai/function-executor.ts`)

#### Added `prepareCancellationForApproval()` method
- Validates cancellation request
- Builds human-readable approval message
- Returns approval request to staff

**Example approval message**:
```
Cancel booking (ID: abc-123) - Reason: Schedule conflict
```

#### Added `executeApprovedCancellation()` method
- Searches for booking if booking_id not provided
- Calls `/api/bookings/[bookingId]/cancel` endpoint
- Sends LINE cancellation notification (optional)
- Handles dry-run mode for testing
- Full error handling

**Smart booking search**:
- If booking_id provided ‚Üí uses it directly
- If only date provided ‚Üí searches by date + customer info
- Handles multiple bookings gracefully (asks for clarification)
- Only cancels active bookings (confirmed/pending)

---

### 3. Approval API (`app/api/ai/approve-booking/route.ts`)

Updated to support both `create_booking` and `cancel_booking`:

```typescript
// Before: Only supported create_booking
if (body.functionResult.functionName !== 'create_booking') {
  return error;
}

// After: Supports both
const supportedFunctions = ['create_booking', 'cancel_booking'];
if (!supportedFunctions.includes(body.functionResult.functionName)) {
  return error;
}

// Routes to appropriate executor
if (functionName === 'create_booking') {
  result = await functionExecutor.executeApprovedBooking(data);
} else if (functionName === 'cancel_booking') {
  result = await functionExecutor.executeApprovedCancellation(data);
}
```

---

## üîÑ Complete Flow

### User Journey

1. **Customer message**: "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday"

2. **AI reasoning**:
   - Detects cancellation intent ("cancel")
   - Checks UPCOMING BOOKINGS context
   - Finds Wednesday booking details
   - Calls `cancel_booking` function

3. **AI function call**:
```json
{
  "name": "cancel_booking",
  "parameters": {
    "booking_id": "abc-123-def-456",
    "date": "2025-10-22",
    "customer_name": "Tim",
    "phone_number": "0922942300",
    "cancellation_reason": "",
    "staff_name": "AI Assistant"
  }
}
```

4. **Function executor**:
   - Validates parameters
   - Returns approval request to staff

5. **Staff UI** (frontend):
   - Shows: "Cancel booking (ID: abc-123) - Reason: Customer requested"
   - Staff clicks "Approve" or "Reject"

6. **If approved**:
   - POST `/api/ai/approve-booking` with cancellation data
   - Calls `executeApprovedCancellation()`
   - Cancels booking in database via `/api/bookings/[id]/cancel`
   - Updates booking status to 'cancelled'
   - Sends LINE notification to customer
   - Returns success to AI

7. **AI response to customer**:
   - "Got it, I've cancelled your Wednesday booking. Let me know if you'd like to reschedule!"

---

## üé® Integration with Existing APIs

### Leverages Existing Endpoints

**‚úÖ `/api/bookings/[bookingId]/cancel`** (POST)
- Already existed in the application
- Handles all cancellation logic:
  - Updates booking status to 'cancelled'
  - Records audit trail (cancelled_by_type, cancelled_by_identifier)
  - Creates booking_history entry
  - Handles calendar sync (commented out, managed by sync system)

**‚úÖ `/api/line/bookings/[bookingId]/send-cancellation`** (POST)
- Already existed
- Sends pretty LINE Flex message to customer
- Handles customer lookup by LINE user ID
- Creates conversation entry
- Gracefully handles if customer not on LINE

**No new API endpoints needed!** Just orchestrates existing ones.

---

## üí° Smart Features

### 1. Flexible Booking Identification

```typescript
// Option A: Direct booking ID (fastest)
cancel_booking({ booking_id: "abc-123", ... })

// Option B: Search by date (if booking_id not in context)
cancel_booking({ date: "2025-10-22", customer_name: "Tim", ... })
```

### 2. Multi-Booking Handling

If multiple bookings found for same date:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Multiple bookings found for 2025-10-22. Please specify booking_id.",
  "data": {
    "bookings": [
      { "id": "abc-1", "name": "Tim", "time": "10:00" },
      { "id": "abc-2", "name": "Tim", "time": "14:00" }
    ]
  }
}
```

AI can then ask customer "Which booking - 10:00 or 14:00?"

### 3. Dry-Run Mode Support

For testing and evaluation:
```typescript
const executor = new AIFunctionExecutor(dryRun: true);
// Returns success without actually cancelling
```

### 4. Optional LINE Notification

- Automatically sends pretty cancellation message to customer's LINE
- If customer doesn't have LINE linked ‚Üí silently continues (doesn't fail)
- Includes booking details, date, time, bay info

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Test Cases to Validate

#### Case 5: "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday"
**Expected behavior**:
1. ‚úÖ AI detects cancellation intent
2. ‚úÖ AI finds Wednesday booking in UPCOMING BOOKINGS context
3. ‚úÖ AI calls `cancel_booking` with booking_id
4. ‚úÖ Returns approval message to staff
5. ‚úÖ On approval, cancels booking successfully
6. ‚úÖ AI responds: "Cancelled your Wednesday booking"

#### Case 20: "‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö 12:00-14:00 ‡∏ä‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠ Day ‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö"
**Expected behavior**:
1. ‚úÖ AI detects "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å" (cancel) keyword
2. ‚úÖ AI extracts time (12:00-14:00) and name (Day)
3. ‚úÖ AI calls `cancel_booking` with date + customer info
4. ‚úÖ Executor searches for matching booking
5. ‚úÖ Finds booking, cancels it
6. ‚úÖ AI responds in Thai: "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞"

### Testing Commands

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Run evaluation against test cases
npm run tsx scripts/evaluate-against-staff-actions.ts

# 3. Or diagnose specific case
# Edit scripts/diagnose-single-case.ts
# Set CASE_ID = 'b84251a7-fbff-4864-a28f-9add46125158-25' (Case 5)
npm run tsx scripts/diagnose-single-case.ts
```

### Expected Improvement

**Before**: 50% accuracy (10/20 passing)
**After**: 60% accuracy (12/20 passing)
- ‚úÖ Case 5: Now passes
- ‚úÖ Case 20: Now passes
- +10% improvement from cancel_booking alone
- Combined with Tier 1 improvements ‚Üí 70-80% total

## üìù Function Description (for AI)

The AI receives this description in the function schema:

```
Cancel an existing booking. Requires staff approval before execution.

Use this when:
- Customer explicitly requests cancellation: "cancel my booking", "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å", "can't make it"
- Customer says they won't be able to attend: "I won't make it", "need to cancel"
- Customer mentions cancellation keywords: "cancel", "‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏Å", "won't make it"

Do NOT use when:
- Customer is asking IF they can cancel (just answer yes)
- Customer already said "thank you" after cancellation was confirmed
- Booking is already cancelled (check UPCOMING BOOKINGS context first)

Workflow:
1. First check UPCOMING BOOKINGS in context above
2. If booking is listed there, you have enough info to cancel it
3. If booking NOT in UPCOMING BOOKINGS, use lookup_booking first to find it
4. Then call this function with the booking details
```

This guides the AI to:
1. Check context first (avoid unnecessary function calls)
2. Use lookup_booking if needed (multi-step flow)
3. Only call cancel_booking when ready
