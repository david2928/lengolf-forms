## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Mobile URL?

**Check 1: Windows Firewall (MOST COMMON ISSUE)**
- This is usually the problem!
- Run the firewall setup script as Administrator:
  ```powershell
  # Right-click PowerShell â†’ "Run as Administrator"
  .\scripts\allow-mobile-testing.ps1
  ```
- Or manually allow port 3000 through Windows Firewall

**Check 2: Same WiFi Network**
- Verify PC and phone on same WiFi
- Not just "WiFi" - must be the EXACT same network
- Check WiFi name on both devices

**Check 3: Dev Server Running**
```bash
# Make sure server is running:
npm run dev:mobile

# You should see: "Ready on http://0.0.0.0:3000"
```

**Check 4: Test on PC First**
- Open browser on PC
- Try: `http://192.168.1.196:3000`
- If this doesn't work, firewall is blocking it

**Check 4: IP Address Changed**
- WiFi IP can change when you move networks
- Re-run `ipconfig` to get new IP:
  ```bash
  ipconfig
  # Look for "IPv4 Address" under WiFi adapter
  ```

### Page Loads but Auth Issues?

Make sure `SKIP_AUTH=true` in `.env.local`:
```bash
# Check .env.local file contains:
SKIP_AUTH=true
```

2. **Connect Phone via USB**

3. **On PC Chrome:**
   - Navigate to: `chrome://inspect#devices`
   - Click "Inspect" next to your mobile browser tab

4. **Result:**
   - Full DevTools on PC
   - Real keyboard on phone
   - Best of both worlds!

## Current Chat Fix Testing

The recent chat interface fix should now show:
- âœ… Input box fixed to bottom of screen
- âœ… No excessive spacing above keyboard

## Tips

1. **Bookmark on Phone:** Add the URL to your home screen for instant access
2. **Keep Server Running:** Leave `npm run dev:mobile` running while testing
3. **Check Console:** Look for errors in browser DevTools
4. **Test Portrait & Landscape:** Rotate phone to test both orientations
5. **Test Different Keyboards:** Try different input types (text, email, number)

## Need Help?

- **IP Address Changed:** Run `ipconfig` on PC to find new IP
- **Port Already in Use:** Stop other dev servers or use different port
- **Still Not Working:** Try restarting both PC and phone WiFi
