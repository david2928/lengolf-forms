# AI Function Calling - Final State & Documentation

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Status**: Investigation Complete, Bugs Fixed
**Current Accuracy**: 50% (10/20 test cases)
**Improvement**: +67% from baseline (was 30%)

---

## Executive Summary

We successfully investigated and fixed critical bugs in the AI function calling system. The pass rate improved from **30% to 50%**, a **67% relative improvement**. Testing confirmed that **gpt-4o-mini is the optimal model** (60% accuracy vs gpt-4o's 40% on test cases), and it's 10x cheaper.

---

## 🔧 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. maxTokens Too Small (CRITICAL)
**File**: `src/lib/ai/openai-client.ts:20`

**Before**:
```typescript
maxTokens: 150, // Keep responses concise
```

**After**:
```typescript
maxTokens: 500, // Increased from 150 to allow function calls with parameters
```

**Problem**: Function calls need 200-300 tokens for the JSON structure. With maxTokens=150, the AI was getting cut off mid-call (`finish_reason: "length"`).

**Impact**: This was preventing ALL function calls from completing successfully.

---

### 2. DEBUG MODE Interference (CRITICAL)
**File**: `src/lib/ai/suggestion-service.ts:846-860`

**Before**:
```typescript
if (params.dryRun) {
  userContent = userContent + `
DEBUG MODE: After generating your response, add an internal reasoning section at the END:
[INTERNAL REASONING:
- Intent detected: [what you think customer wants]
- Function to call: [which function you chose, or "none"]
...
]`;
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// 6. Add debug reasoning in dry run mode - DISABLED
// This was causing AI to write about functions instead of calling them!
// (commented out)
```

**Problem**: This instruction made the AI write TEXT about which function to call, instead of ACTUALLY calling the function via OpenAI's function calling API.

**Impact**: AI would describe "I should call create_booking" but never make the actual function call.

---

### 3. Strict Mode Schema Violations
**File**: `src/lib/ai/function-schemas.ts` (all 5 functions)

**Problem**: With `strict: true`, OpenAI requires ALL properties in the schema to be in the `required` array. We had optional parameters that weren't marked correctly.

**Fix**: Added all properties to `required` array and used empty strings ("") as default values for truly optional fields.

**Example**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
required: ['date', 'duration']  // start_time was optional

// AFTER
required: ['date', 'start_time', 'duration', 'bay_type']
// Now use empty string "" for optional values
```

---

### 4. Improved Function Descriptions
**File**: `src/lib/ai/function-schemas.ts`

**Changes**:
- Simplified from 163-line descriptions to 10-15 lines
- Added clear "Use this when" and "Do NOT use when" sections
- Included specific examples of customer messages

**Example**:
```typescript
description: `Create a bay or coaching booking. Requires staff approval before execution.

Use this when:
- Customer confirms time after availability check: "3.30pm please!", "Confirm 19:00", "book it"
- Customer directly requests booking: "I want to book 2pm", "ขอจอง 14:00", "reserve tomorrow"
- Customer says booking words: "book", "จอง", "reserve", "reservation"

Do NOT use when:
- Customer only asks "available?" without confirming (use check_bay_availability first)
- Customer is asking general questions
...`
```

---

### 5. Added Customer Journey Context
**File**: `src/lib/ai/suggestion-service.ts` (system prompt)

**Added**:
```
TYPICAL CUSTOMER FLOWS:

1. General Questions (no function needed)
   - Customer asks about facilities, pricing, location, equipment
   - Just respond with information from your knowledge base

2. Booking Flow (2-step process)
   Step 1: Customer asks "available tomorrow 2pm?" → Use check_bay_availability function
   Step 2: Staff confirms "yes available" → Customer says "book it" → Use create_booking

3. Direct Booking (skip availability check)
   - Customer says "I want to book 2pm tomorrow" → Use create_booking immediately

4. Cancellation
   - Customer wants to cancel → Check UPCOMING BOOKINGS in context

5. Package Questions
   - Customer asks "how many hours left?" → Use lookup_customer function
```

**Impact**: Helped AI understand the booking workflow and when to call which function.

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Passing Test Cases (10/20):
1. ✅ "Confirm 19.00-20.00 ka" → create_booking
2. ✅ "I'll do tues 28 19.00-20.99 ka" → create_booking *(NEW!)*
3. ✅ "Buy 1 free 1?" → NO_FUNCTION (correct conversational response)
6. ✅ "Corporate event รองรับได้สูงสุดกี่คนคะ" → NO_FUNCTION (conversational)
7. ✅ "ขอบคุณค่ะ" → NO_FUNCTION (conversational)
8. ✅ "จอดรถที่เมอคิวรี่ได้เลยใช่มั๊ยครับ" → NO_FUNCTION (conversational)
9. ✅ "ขอจอง AI Bay 10.00-11.00 น." → create_booking *(NEW!)*
12. ✅ "ขอบคุณครับ" → NO_FUNCTION (conversational)
14. ✅ "3.30pm please!" → create_booking
19. ✅ Marketing message → NO_FUNCTION (conversational)

**Key Improvements**: Tests #2 and #9 now work - complex booking intents are being recognized!

## ❌ Still Failing (10/20)

### Remaining Issues:
4. ❌ "May i see?" - Context understanding (should create booking after discussion)
5. ❌ "Bro gotta cancel on Wednesday" - Wrong function (calls lookup_booking instead of check_bay_availability)
10. ❌ "ตอนแรกจองกอล์ฟไว้วันนี้ 13.00 น" - Follow-up booking scenario
11. ❌ "ไปถึงสัก 18.30 น นะครับ" - Arrival time (not a booking request)
13. ❌ "มันตีใส่จอเหมือน bay ทั่วไปไหม" - Should check availability
15. ❌ "Thank you and sorry again" - Post-booking gratitude
16. ❌ "Thank you" - Post-booking gratitude
18. ❌ "จอง2 ชม แล้วตอนเรียนค่อยไปลงชื่อทีละชมหรอครับ" - Follow-up question
20. ❌ "สวัสดีครับรอบ 12:00-14:00 ชื่อ Day ยกเลิกนะครับ" - Cancellation (should lookup booking first)

### Patterns in Failures:
- **Context-dependent scenarios** (requires understanding previous conversation)
- **Cancellation intent** (AI doesn't recognize need to lookup booking first)
- **Follow-up questions** (after booking is already created)
- **Gratitude responses** (AI struggles to maintain conversational flow)

## 🔍 Investigation Tools & Scripts

### Keep These Scripts (Production-Ready):
1. **`scripts/evaluate-against-staff-actions.ts`** - Main evaluation script comparing AI vs actual staff actions
2. **`scripts/test-model-comparison.ts`** - Model comparison testing (gpt-4o-mini vs gpt-4o)
3. **`scripts/diagnose-single-case.ts`** - Deep diagnostic tool for single conversations

### Archive/Remove These (Investigation Only):
- `scripts/evaluate-failing-cases-only.ts` - Temporary debugging
- `scripts/detailed-case-analysis.ts` - One-time analysis
- `scripts/evaluate-multi-turn.ts` - Older version
- `scripts/evaluate-real-multi-turn.ts` - Older version
- Various CSV exports (can be regenerated)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (To Reach 70-80%)

### Option A: Prompt Engineering (Low Cost)
1. Add few-shot examples to system prompt showing successful function calls
2. Improve cancellation intent detection
3. Better context awareness for follow-up scenarios

### Option B: Two-Step Reasoning (Medium Cost)
1. First call: AI analyzes intent and decides action
2. Second call: AI executes the function
More reliable but 2x API calls

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
1. Use gpt-4o for complex scenarios (cancellations, follow-ups)
2. Use gpt-4o-mini for simple scenarios (direct bookings, availability)
3. Route based on message complexity

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Changes:
- `src/lib/ai/openai-client.ts` - maxTokens: 150 → 500
- `src/lib/ai/suggestion-service.ts` - Removed DEBUG MODE, added customer journey context
- `src/lib/ai/function-schemas.ts` - Fixed strict mode, improved all 5 function descriptions

### Test & Evaluation:
- `scripts/evaluate-against-staff-actions.ts` - LLM-based evaluation against real staff actions
- `scripts/test-model-comparison.ts` - Model comparison framework
- `scripts/diagnose-single-case.ts` - Deep diagnostic tool

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **maxTokens matters for function calling** - Too small prevents function calls from completing
2. **Don't tell AI to describe, tell it to act** - DEBUG MODE was counterproductive
3. **gpt-4o-mini > gpt-4o for our use case** - Better accuracy, faster, cheaper
4. **Strict mode requires careful schema design** - All properties must be in required array
5. **Context is king** - Adding customer journey context improved understanding
6. **Simple descriptions work better** - 10-15 lines beats 163 lines
7. **Real conversation evaluation > synthetic tests** - LLM-as-judge approach reveals actual performance

## ✅ Production Readiness

**Current State**: 50% accuracy is acceptable for **assistant mode** (staff review/approve before sending)

**NOT ready for**: Autonomous mode (would need 80%+ accuracy)

**Recommended Use**:
- Enable AI suggestions in unified chat
- Staff reviews and edits before sending
- Functions require explicit staff approval (already implemented)
- Monitor accuracy and iterate based on real usage
