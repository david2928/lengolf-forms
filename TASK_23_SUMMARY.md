# Task 23: Improve Weekly Schedule Overview Tablet Responsiveness - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Schedule Deletion Issue
**Problem**: "Schedule not found" error when attempting to delete entries
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent ID field usage between database function and API endpoint
**Solution**: 
- Fixed ID field extraction in admin page to handle both `schedule_id` and `id` fields
- Added proper error handling and validation in DELETE API endpoint
- Added UUID format validation to prevent invalid requests
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging

### 2. Tablet Responsiveness Issues
**Problem**: Poor display and interaction on tablet devices
**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Time Format Display
- Added `formatTime()` function to convert 24-hour format to 12-hour AM/PM format
- Improved time display readability on smaller screens

#### Responsive Layout Improvements
- **Grid Layout**: Changed from fixed 7-column grid to responsive layout
  - Mobile: Single column with day headers
  - Tablet+: 7-column grid layout
- **Touch Targets**: Added `touch-manipulation` class and increased button sizes
- **Text Sizing**: Implemented responsive text sizing (`text-xs sm:text-sm`)
- **Spacing**: Added responsive padding and margins (`p-2 sm:p-3`)

#### Mobile-First Enhancements
- **Day Headers**: Added mobile-specific day headers that show/hide based on screen size
- **Navigation**: Improved week navigation with better mobile layout
- **Button Sizing**: Responsive button text ("Add Schedule" → "Add" on mobile)
