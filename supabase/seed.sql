-- Seed data for Supabase preview branches
-- This file is used to populate preview branches with sample test data
-- Production data is NEVER copied to preview branches for security

-- NOTE: This seed data is only applied when a preview branch is first created
-- To re-seed, you must delete and recreate the preview branch

-- Example: Insert test customer data
-- INSERT INTO backoffice.customers (full_name, phone_number, email, notes)
-- VALUES
--   ('Test Customer 1', '0812345678', 'test1@example.com', 'Preview branch test data'),
--   ('Test Customer 2', '0823456789', 'test2@example.com', 'Preview branch test data');

-- Example: Insert test staff data
-- INSERT INTO backoffice.staff (name, email, role)
-- VALUES
--   ('Test Staff', 'staff@example.com', 'instructor');

-- Add your seed data below as needed for testing
-- Keep this file in version control
