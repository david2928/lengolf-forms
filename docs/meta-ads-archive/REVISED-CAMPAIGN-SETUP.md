# LENGOLF Meta Ads - Revised Campaign Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Based on:** Your corrections + Facebook Messenger research

---

## Your Corrections (Thank you!)

1. ‚úÖ **"Sales - Book Now"** is actually **Traffic (LPV)**, not Sales objective
2. ‚úÖ **Don't track conversions** - customers book via call/LINE after landing
3. ‚úÖ **Retargeting for Traffic** - Possible via website visitors, not ad clickers
4. ‚úÖ **Why not Messenger?** - Good question! Research shows it works well in Thailand

  content_name: 'Booking Page View',

Settings:

```
