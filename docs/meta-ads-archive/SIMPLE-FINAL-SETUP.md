## How to Set Up Campaign 4 (B2B) with ONE Objective

### In Meta Ads Manager:

**Campaign Level:**
```
Campaign Name: "LENGOLF - B2B Corporate Events"
Objective: Traffic ‚Üê ONE objective only
Buying Type: Auction
```

**Ad Set 4.1:**
```
Name: "Corporate - Landing Page"
Traffic Type: Website
Optimization: Landing Page Views ‚Üê Different optimization
Destination: booking.len.golf
Budget: ‡∏ø4,000/month
Audience: HR Managers, Event Coordinators, etc.
```

**Ad Set 4.2:**
```
Name: "Corporate - LINE Conversations"
Traffic Type: Website
Optimization: Link Clicks ‚Üê Different optimization
Destination: https://line.me/R/ti/p/@lengolf
Budget: ‡∏ø2,000/month
Audience: Same as 4.1 but broader
```

**Ad Set 4.3:**
```
Name: "Corporate - Retargeting"
Traffic Type: Website
Optimization: Landing Page Views ‚Üê Different optimization
Destination: booking.len.golf
Budget: ‡∏ø1,000/month
Audience: Website visitors (last 14 days)
```

**Key Point:** ONE objective (Traffic), but THREE different optimizations within adsets!

---

## Alternative: Should Campaign 4 Use Sales Objective Instead?

### Option: B2B as Sales Objective

**Only if you can track corporate event bookings:**

```
Campaign 4: Sales - B2B Corporate Events

Objective: Sales ‚Üê Different objective
Optimization: Purchase (or Lead event)
Destination: booking.len.golf only (no LINE mixing)
Conversion Event: Meta Pixel "Purchase" or custom "Corporate_Event_Inquiry"

Requirements:
- Meta Pixel installed
- Fire "Purchase" event when corporate event is booked
- OR create custom "Corporate_Event_Inquiry" event
- Need 50+ events/week for optimization (you won't have this initially)

Adsets:
- All target booking.len.golf
- Can't mix LINE link strategy
```

**Should you use Sales for Campaign 4?**

| Factor | Traffic Objective | Sales Objective |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Can mix landing page + LINE | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Optimizes for clicks/traffic | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Optimizes for conversions | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Needs conversion tracking | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (required) |
| Needs 50+ conversions/week | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (required) |
| Good for long sales cycle | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Good for multi-channel | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

**My Recommendation for Campaign 4: Use Traffic**

**Why:**
1. B2B has long sales cycle (inquiry ‚Üí quote ‚Üí site visit ‚Üí booking)
2. You want flexibility (landing page + LINE)
3. Don't have 50+ corporate bookings/week yet for Sales optimization
4. Easier to manage and track

**Future Option:**
- Start with Traffic objective
- After 3-6 months, if you have consistent corporate bookings
- Consider testing Sales objective
- Compare performance
