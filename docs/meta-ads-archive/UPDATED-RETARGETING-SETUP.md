## Creative Strategy for Expanded Retargeting

### For People Who Only Engaged on Social (Never Visited Website):

**Creative Angle:** "You liked our posts - Now book your bay!"

```
Primary Text: "Saw our videos on Instagram? Time to experience it yourself! üèåÔ∏è"

Headline: "Book Your Bay - Special Offer for Followers"

Description: "10% off your first booking - Use code: SOCIAL10"

CTA: "Book Now"
```

### For Website Visitors (Didn't Book):

**Creative Angle:** "Come back and book"

```
Primary Text: "Still thinking about trying LENGOLF? Limited slots available!"

Headline: "Complete Your Booking"

Description: "Same-day bookings available"

CTA: "Book Now"
```

### For Video Viewers:

**Creative Angle:** "From watching to playing"

```
Primary Text: "Loved our videos? It's even better in person!"

Headline: "Experience What You Watched"

CTA: "Book Now"
```

**Option:** Use **Dynamic Creative** to test all 3 angles automatically

## Benefits of Expanded Retargeting

### 1. Bigger Audience Pool
- 4,000-10,000 people (vs 800-2,000)
- Better for Meta's algorithm to optimize
- More stable ad delivery

### 2. Capture Full Funnel
```
Cold ‚Üí Warm ‚Üí Hot

Currently missing:
‚ùå Engaged on social but never visited website

Now capturing:
‚úÖ Instagram likes/comments ‚Üí Haven't visited ‚Üí Retarget them!
‚úÖ Facebook video views ‚Üí Haven't visited ‚Üí Retarget them!
‚úÖ Website visitors ‚Üí Haven't booked ‚Üí Retarget them!
```

### 3. Lower Costs
- Bigger audience = lower CPM (competition spread across more people)

### 4. Better Attribution
- You'll capture people who:
  - See ad on Instagram ‚Üí Engage with post ‚Üí See retargeting ad ‚Üí Visit website ‚Üí Book
