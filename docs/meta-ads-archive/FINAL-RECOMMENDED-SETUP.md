## Summary: Why ‡∏ø7K-15K for B2B Makes Sense

### The Math

**1 Corporate Event = 25-40 Normal Bookings in Revenue**
- Corporate event: ‡∏ø20,000-30,000
- Normal booking: ‡∏ø800

**Your Current B2B Performance:**
- ‡∏ø2,397 spent ‚Üí 1 lead ‚Üí 0 events ‚Üí ‡∏ø0 revenue
- **ROI: -100%** üò±

**New B2B Strategy:**

- **ROI: +9,233% to +19,900%** üöÄüöÄüöÄ

### Why It Works

1. **High Intent:** Corporate event planners NEED venues (not browsing)
2. **Higher Budget:** Companies have ‡∏ø50K-200K event budgets
3. **Urgency:** Year-end events must happen (can't postpone)
4. **Premium Service:** LENGOLF has Fortune 500 client proof
5. **Recurring:** Good corporate clients come back annually
