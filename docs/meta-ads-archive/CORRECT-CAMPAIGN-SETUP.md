## How to Set Up "Click-to-Messenger" with Traffic Objective

### Step 1: Get Your Messenger Link

Your Facebook Messenger link format:
```
m.me/[your-page-username]
```

Find it:
1. Go to your Facebook Page
2. Click "About"
3. Look for "Messenger Link" or create username
4. Example: `m.me/lengolfbangkok`

### Step 2: Create Traffic Campaign

```
Campaign Level:
- Objective: Traffic ‚úÖ
- Campaign name: "LENGOLF - B2C Messenger Conversations"

Ad Set Level:
- Traffic type: Website (yes, even for Messenger!)
- Conversion location: Website
- Optimization: Link Clicks
- Audience: [your targeting]

Ad Level:
- Primary text: "Questions about our golf simulators? Chat with us!"
- Headline: "Send us a message"
- Description: "We're here to help!"
- Call to Action: "Send Message"
- Website URL: m.me/lengolfbangkok ‚Üê This makes it open Messenger!
```

### Step 3: When User Clicks

1. User sees your ad
2. Clicks "Send Message" button
3. **Messenger app opens automatically**
4. Conversation starts
5. Your auto-response sends immediately
6. Staff responds from Facebook Page inbox

### Step 4: Track Conversations

Metrics to watch:
- Link Clicks (people who clicked to Messenger)
- CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- CPC (Cost per Click)
- Manual tracking: Count conversations in Facebook inbox
- Tag conversations with "Meta Ad - B2C" in notes

---

## Alternative: Use "Sales" Objective for Conversions

If you want Meta to optimize for actual bookings:

### Option: CAMPAIGN 1 as "Sales" Instead of "Traffic"

**Only if you can track conversions:**

```
Campaign 1: Sales - Direct Bookings (‡∏ø8,000/month)

Objective: Sales ‚úÖ
Optimization: Purchase (or Lead event)
Destination: booking.len.golf
Conversion tracking: Meta Pixel Purchase event

Requirements:
- Must have Meta Pixel installed
- Must fire "Purchase" event when booking confirmed
- Meta needs 50+ conversions/week to optimize (you'll get there!)

Adsets: Same as before
- 1.1 Lookalike
- 1.2 Broad
- 1.3 Retargeting
```

**Should you use Sales objective?**

‚úÖ **YES, if:**
- You can track when someone books (via Meta Pixel Purchase event)
- You're okay with Meta optimizing for "online bookings only" (not phone/LINE bookings)
- You get 50+ trackable bookings per week

‚ùå **NO, if:**
- Most customers book via phone/LINE after seeing the page
- You can't track conversions reliably
- You prefer to just drive traffic and let customers convert however they want

**My recommendation:**
- **Start with Traffic objective** (safer, simpler)
- Add Meta Pixel Purchase event
- After 2-4 weeks, if you see 50+ tracked purchases/week, switch to Sales objective
- Test both and compare

## Corrected Campaign Objectives

| Campaign | Your Strategy | Correct Objective | Optimization |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| LPV Traffic | Drive traffic to booking page | **Traffic** | Landing Page Views |
| Engagement | Brand awareness, reach | **Engagement** | Post Engagement |
| B2C Conversations | Messenger chats | **Traffic** | Link Clicks (to m.me link) |
| B2B - Landing Page | Corporate inquiries | **Traffic** | Landing Page Views |
| B2B - LINE Chats | LINE conversations | **Traffic** | Link Clicks (to LINE link) |

**Key Insight:** There's no "Messages" objective in current Meta Ads Manager. Use **Traffic objective with Messenger/LINE links** instead.

---

## Technical Setup

### 1. Meta Pixel (for Campaign 1 - LPV)

```javascript
// ViewContent - fires when page loads
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_name: 'Booking Page',
  value: 600,
  currency: 'THB'
});

// Optional: Purchase event (if you want Sales objective later)
fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
  value: booking_total,
  currency: 'THB'
});
```

### 2. Get Facebook Messenger Link

1. Go to facebook.com/lengolf.bangkok (your page)
2. Click "About" ‚Üí "Edit Page Info"
3. Create username if you don't have one
4. Your Messenger link: `m.me/[username]`

### 3. Get LINE OA Link

You already have: `https://line.me/R/ti/p/@lengolf`

### 4. Website Retargeting Audience

```
Meta Ads Manager ‚Üí Audiences ‚Üí Create Custom Audience ‚Üí
Website Traffic ‚Üí
People who visited specific web pages ‚Üí
URL contains: booking.len.golf ‚Üí
Last 7 days
```

### 5. Facebook Page Inbox Setup

For Messenger conversations (Campaign 3):

```
Facebook Page ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Messaging ‚Üí

Instant Reply (auto-response):
"üëã Hi! Thanks for reaching out to LENGOLF!

What would you like to know?
