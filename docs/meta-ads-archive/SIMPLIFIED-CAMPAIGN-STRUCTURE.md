```tsx
// Add to booking.len.golf layout
<a
  href="https://line.me/R/ti/p/@lengolf"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="fixed bottom-6 right-6 z-50 bg-[#00B900] hover:bg-[#00A000] text-white px-5 py-3 rounded-full shadow-xl flex items-center gap-2"

</a>
```

**Where to place:**

- Header: Next to phone number
- Below pricing: "Questions? Chat with us"

---

### Step 2: Set Up Meta Pixel Events (1 hour)

You already have GTM (GTM-MKCHVJKW). Add these events:

```javascript
// Event 1: Page View (booking page loads)
fbq('track', 'ViewContent', {
  content_name: 'Booking Page',
  content_category: 'Golf Booking',
  value: 600,
  currency: 'THB'
});

// Event 2: Booking Complete
fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
  content_name: 'Booking Confirmed',
  value: {{booking_total}}, // Dynamic from your booking system
  currency: 'THB'
});

// Event 3: LINE Chat Click (optional)
// Add to LINE button onClick
fbq('track', 'Lead', {
  content_name: 'LINE Chat Started'
});
```

**How to add in GTM:**
1. Go to GTM dashboard
2. Create new tag ‚Üí Custom HTML
3. Add pixel events above
4. Set triggers (Page View, Booking Success)
5. Test with Meta Events Manager
6. Publish

---

### Step 3: LINE OA Auto-Responses (30 min)

Set up basic auto-replies in LINE OA Manager:

**Auto-Reply 1: Welcome Message**
```

## Why This Simple Setup Works

1. **Uses what you have:**
   - ‚úÖ booking.len.golf already works
   - ‚úÖ LINE OA already operational
   - ‚úÖ unified-chat already handles messages
   - ‚úÖ Staff already available 10am-11pm

2. **Eliminates spam:**
   - No more lead forms = no more 43% spam
   - Real people who want to book

3. **Lower friction:**
   - Book directly online (fastest)
   - OR chat on LINE (easiest)
   - No form filling required

4. **Instagram focus:**
   - Your data proves it's 70% better
   - 65% of budget goes there

5. **Can start small:**
   - Test with ‡∏ø700 first week
   - Prove it works before scaling
   - No big risk

---

## Quick Start (Do This First!)

**Today (1-2 hours):**
1. Add LINE button to booking.len.golf
2. Set up LINE auto-replies
3. Pause B2B lead form campaign (save ‡∏ø2,400!)

**This Week (2-3 hours):**
4. Add Meta Pixel events via GTM
5. Create 1 test campaign (Instagram only, ‡∏ø100/day)
6. Launch and monitor

**Next Week:**
7. If test works ‚Üí Scale to full setup
8. If test doesn't work ‚Üí Fix and retry

---

## My Recommendation

**Start with the ‡∏ø700 test (Week 2 above):**
- Low risk (only ‡∏ø700)
- Quick validation (7 days)
- If you get 15-20 bookings from ‡∏ø700, you'll know it works
- Then scale confidently

**Don't overthink it. The setup is simple:**
1. Add LINE button (30 min)
2. Add Meta Pixel (1 hour)
3. Create 1 test campaign (1 hour)
4. Launch (1 min)
5. Check results in 7 days

**Total time investment: ~3 hours**
**Potential upside: 100x more bookings**
