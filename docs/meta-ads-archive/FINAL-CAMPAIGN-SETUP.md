### CAMPAIGN 2: Sales - Book Now (KEEP & SCALE!) - ‡∏ø6,000/month

**Objective:** OUTCOME_SALES (Conversions)
**Destination:** booking.len.golf

- Bookings: 19
- Cost per booking: ‡∏ø253

---

### CAMPAIGN 3: Engagement (Minimal - Pure Reach) - ‡∏ø2,000/month

**Objective:** OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT
**Destination:** Facebook/Instagram Page (NOT booking.len.golf)
**Goal:** Brand awareness, feed lookalike audiences, cheap reach
**Why:** ‡∏ø16 CPM is VERY cheap, builds brand, seeds retargeting

- Location: Bangkok 10km radius
- Interests: Golf, Entertainment, Lifestyle
- Platform: 60% Facebook, 40% Instagram

- Feeds your lookalike audiences
- Seeds retargeting pool
- CPM: ‡∏ø16 (very cheap!)
```

**Purpose:**

- Build social proof (page engagement)
- Create retargeting pool
- Feed data to other campaigns
- **Not meant to drive bookings directly**

---

### CAMPAIGN 4: Corporate Events (B2B) - ‡∏ø3,500/month

**Objective:** OUTCOME_SALES (NOT Lead Forms!)
**Destination:** Mix of booking.len.golf + LINE OA

CTA: "Chat with Our Events Team"

Audience:
- Same as above but broader
- Interests: Business networking, Corporate wellness
- Platform: 70% Facebook, 30% Instagram

Creative:

Expected:
- 25-35 LINE conversations
- 4-6 event bookings (after conversation)
- Cost per conversation: ‡∏ø43-60
- Cost per booking: ‡∏ø250-375
```

**Campaign 4 Total:**

     content_name: 'Booking Page',
     value: 600,
     currency: 'THB'
   });

   // Purchase - for Sales campaigns
   fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
     value: {{booking_total}},
     currency: 'THB',
     booking_id: {{booking_id}}
   });
   ```

## Creative Strategy

### Campaign 1 (LPV) - Direct Response
**Goal:** Drive clicks to booking page

**Creative Types:**
1. **Video (10-15 sec):**
   - Facility walkthrough
   - Customer playing and having fun
   - Bay features + Bravo simulator
   - CTA: "Book Your Bay"

2. **Carousel:**
   - Slide 1: Bay interior
   - Slide 2: Bravo simulator screen
   - Slide 3: Group of friends playing
   - Slide 4: Pricing + "Book Now"

3. **Static Image:**
   - High-quality bay photo
   - Text overlay: "Indoor Golf in Bangkok"
   - CTA: "Book Now"

**All link to:** booking.len.golf

### Campaign 2 (Sales) - Keep Current Creatives
**What's working:**
- Your existing videos ("All in bay", "SimxDriving Range", "weekend-catch-up")
- Retargeting approach
- CTA: "Book Now"
- CTR: 6.13% is EXCELLENT!

**Action:**
- Keep best performing creatives
- Pause the 9 wasting money (from analysis)
- Test new variations slowly

### Campaign 3 (Engagement) - Entertaining Content
**Goal:** Brand awareness, not bookings

**Creative Types:**
1. Customer testimonials (video)
2. Behind-the-scenes content
3. Golf tips and tricks
4. Fun moments / blooper reels
5. Facility tours
6. Staff introductions

**NO direct CTA** - just engaging content

### Campaign 4 (Corporate) - Professional + Social Proof
**Goal:** Appeal to HR/event planners

**Creative Types:**
1. **Video:**
   - Past corporate events montage
   - Show: Large groups, professional setting, fun activities
   - Client logos (if allowed): AWS, Epson, BofA
   - CTA: "Plan Your Event"

2. **Carousel:**
   - Event packages comparison
   - Venue capacity options
   - Food & beverage options
   - Testimonials from corporate clients

3. **Static:**
   - Professional event photo
   - Text: "Where Fortune 500 Companies Team Build"
   - CTA: "Get Quote" or "Chat with Events Team"

---

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring (First 2 weeks)

**Campaign 1 (LPV):**
- Landing page views: Target 50-80/day
- Cost per LPV: Target ‡∏ø5-7
- Direct bookings: Track in booking system (tag source as "Meta - LPV")
- Bounce rate: Monitor in GA

**Campaign 2 (Sales):**
- Keep current performance (‡∏ø214-250 per booking)
- Purchase events firing correctly
- 1-2 bookings per day

**Campaign 4 (Corporate):**
- LINE conversations: 1-2/day
- Sales events: 0.2-0.4/day (not daily, but 1-2 per week)
- Quote requests

### Weekly Review

**Overall Performance:**
- Total bookings from Meta ads
- Cost per booking by campaign
- Platform efficiency (Instagram vs Facebook)
- Best performing creative by campaign

**Optimization Actions:**
- Pause creatives with >‡∏ø300 spend and 0 results
- Scale creatives with <‡∏ø50 cost per booking
- Adjust audience if needed
- Update creative if fatigue detected

### Monthly Analysis

**ROI Calculation:**
- Total ad spend: ‡∏ø19,500
- Total bookings: Track by source
- Revenue generated: Booking value √ó quantity
- Target ROI: >500% (very achievable!)

**Strategic Questions:**
- Which audiences convert best?
- What creative themes work best?
- Instagram vs Facebook performance?
- Should we scale budget further?

---

## Why This Setup Works

### 1. Keeps What's Working
‚úÖ Your "Sales - Book Now" campaign is ALREADY good (‡∏ø253 per booking)
‚úÖ Engagement campaign provides cheap reach (‡∏ø16 CPM)
‚úÖ Just scale these up 20-25%

### 2. Replaces What's Failing
‚ùå B2C Lead Forms ‚Üí Traffic to landing page (eliminates 43% spam)
‚ùå B2B Lead Forms ‚Üí Sales + LINE conversations (actual bookings, not form fills)

### 3. Matches Your Strategy
‚úÖ LPV Traffic ‚Üí Lookalike / Broad / Golfers (exactly what you wanted!)
‚úÖ Engagement ‚Üí Minimal, purely reach (exactly what you wanted!)
‚úÖ B2B ‚Üí Sales/Messages (exactly what you wanted!)
‚úÖ B2C ‚Üí Sales objective (your "Sales - Book Now" proves this works!)

### 4. Uses Your Existing Assets
‚úÖ booking.len.golf (already built)
‚úÖ LINE OA (already operational)
‚úÖ unified-chat (already functional)
‚úÖ Meta Pixel (just need to add events)

### 5. Lower Risk
- Start with 50% budget in new campaigns (Week 2)
- Validate before full scale (Week 3)
- Can revert if needed
- Keep working campaigns running throughout

---

## Summary: What Changes vs What Stays

### ‚úÖ KEEP (Already Working)
- **Campaign:** "Sales - Book Now" ‚Üí Scale from ‡∏ø4,812 to ‡∏ø6,000
- **Campaign:** "Engagement" ‚Üí Keep at ‡∏ø2,000 (minimal reach play)

### ‚ùå REPLACE (Not Working)
- **Campaign:** "B2C Lead Form" (‡∏ø9,638) ‚Üí Replace with "Traffic (LPV)" (‡∏ø8,000)
- **Campaign:** "B2B Lead Form" (‡∏ø2,397) ‚Üí Replace with "Corporate B2B" (‡∏ø3,500)

### üÜï NEW TOTAL
- Campaign 1: Traffic (LPV) - ‡∏ø8,000
- Campaign 2: Sales - Book Now - ‡∏ø6,000 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- Campaign 3: Engagement - ‡∏ø2,000 ‚úÖ
- Campaign 4: Corporate (B2B) - ‡∏ø3,500
- **Total: ‡∏ø19,500** (vs current ‡∏ø20,330 - actually ‡∏ø800 less!)

---

## Next Steps

**Option A: Full Implementation (Recommended)**
1. Week 1: Pause wasting creatives + Add Meta Pixel + Add LINE button
2. Week 2: Launch new campaigns at 50% + Scale working campaigns
3. Week 3: Validate and optimize
4. Week 4: Full scale if working

**Option B: Conservative Test**
1. Week 1: Setup only (Pixel, LINE button)
2. Week 2: Launch ONE adset from Campaign 1 (‡∏ø100/day for 7 days = ‡∏ø700 test)
3. Week 3: If test works, launch full setup
4. Week 4: Scale

**Option C: Just Optimize Current**
1. Pause 9 wasting creatives (save ‡∏ø10K/month)
2. Add Meta Pixel events
3. Scale "Sales - Book Now" to ‡∏ø8,000
4. Keep everything else same
5. **Easiest option, but less upside**
