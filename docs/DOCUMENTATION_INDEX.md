- **REDUNDANT**: `pos/POS_RECEIPT_PRINTING.md` (Subset of receipt system, 90% overlap)
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Consolidate POS product documentation and merge receipt printing into receipt system

#### ETL and Data Pipeline Redundancy
- **PRIMARY**: `POS_DATA_PIPELINE.md` (Complete ETL documentation)
- **REDUNDANT**: `COMPLETE_ETL_PROCESS.md` (Earlier version, 70% overlap)
