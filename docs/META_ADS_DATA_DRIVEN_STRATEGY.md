|--------|----------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Google Ads** | 67 | ‡∏øX | ‡∏øX | üü¢ **Benchmark** |
| **Facebook** | 16 | ‡∏ø2,691* | ‡∏ø168* | üü° **Moderate** |

*\*Estimated 50/50 split between Facebook/Instagram spend*

### **Key Insights from Real Data**
1. **Meta Attribution IS Working**: 36 confirmed bookings (16 FB + 20 IG)
2. **Instagram > Facebook**: 25% better performance (20 vs 16 bookings)
