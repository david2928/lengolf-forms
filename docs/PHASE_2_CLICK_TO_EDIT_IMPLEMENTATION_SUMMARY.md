# Phase 2 Click-to-Edit Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the click-to-edit functionality for the bookings calendar, allowing users to click on any booking event to open an edit modal with full booking management capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Enhancement (`app/api/bookings/[bookingId]/route.ts`)
- **Added GET method** for fetching individual booking details
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/bookings/[bookingId]`
- **Response format**: `{ booking: Booking }`
- **Error handling**: 404 for not found, 500 for server errors
- **Integration**: Works with existing PUT method for updates

### 2. Calendar Event Component Enhancement (`src/components/calendar/CalendarEvent.tsx`)
- **Added `onEditClick` prop** to handle click events
- **Updated interface** to accept the edit callback function
- **Enhanced click handler** to call the edit function with booking ID
- **Maintained fallback** alert for development/testing
- **Preserved all existing functionality** (visual states, hover effects, etc.)

### 3. View Components Integration
#### SideBySideView (`src/components/calendar/SideBySideView.tsx`)
- **Added `onEditClick` prop** to component interface
- **Passed through to CalendarEvent** components
- **Maintained compact view functionality**

#### TraditionalView (`src/components/calendar/TraditionalView.tsx`)
- **Added `onEditClick` prop** to component interface
- **Passed through to CalendarEvent** components in both mobile and desktop views
- **Maintained all existing view modes**

### 4. Main Calendar Page Integration (`app/bookings-calendar/page.tsx`)
- **Added EditBookingModal import** and toast notifications
- **Implemented modal state management**:
  - `isEditModalOpen`: Controls modal visibility
  - `selectedBookingForEdit`: Stores booking data for editing
- **Created edit handlers**:
  - `handleOpenEditModal`: Fetches booking details and opens modal
  - `handleCloseEditModal`: Closes modal and clears state
  - `handleEditSuccess`: Handles successful updates with refresh
- **Added modal to JSX** with proper prop binding
- **Passed `onEditClick` prop** to both view components

### 5. Data Flow Implementation
```
User clicks booking → CalendarEvent.onEditClick(bookingId) → 
handleOpenEditModal(bookingId) → GET /api/bookings/[bookingId] → 
setSelectedBookingForEdit(booking) → EditBookingModal opens → 
User edits and saves → handleEditSuccess → Refresh calendar data
```

## Key Features

### 4. **Cross-Platform Support**
- Works in both mobile and desktop views
- Supports both Traditional and Side-by-Side view modes
