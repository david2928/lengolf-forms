## Overview

The Lead Feedback System (`/lead-feedback`) is a comprehensive customer relationship management tool that handles two primary workflows: **New Leads** from marketing channels and **OB (Outbound) Sales** using customer audiences from the Customer Outreach system. It serves as the central hub for lead qualification, customer outreach, and sales conversion tracking.

### Primary Functions
- **Lead Processing**: Handle incoming leads from Meta/Google Ads with speed-to-lead tracking
- **OB Sales Management**: Conduct outbound sales calls using targeted customer audiences
- **Call Documentation**: Record detailed call outcomes and follow-up requirements
- **Performance Analytics**: Track conversion rates, response times, and sales metrics
- **Follow-up Coordination**: Manage scheduled follow-up calls and customer nurturing

## System Architecture

### Dual-Tab Interface
The system operates with two distinct but integrated workflows:

```typescript
type ActiveTab = 'new-leads' | 'ob-sales';

// Tab switching with state preservation
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'new-leads' | 'ob-sales'>('new-leads');
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Marketing Channels → New Leads Tab → Lead Processing → Feedback Recording
Customer Outreach → Audience Selection → OB Sales Tab → Call Management
```

## New Leads Management

### Lead Sources
- **Meta Ads**: Facebook/Instagram lead forms
- **Google Ads**: Search and display campaign leads  
- **Organic**: Direct website submissions
- **Referrals**: Customer referral programs

### Lead States
```typescript
interface Lead {
  id: string;
  is_opened: boolean;        // Lead has been opened for processing
  is_followup: boolean;      // Requires follow-up action
  needs_followup: boolean;   // System-flagged for follow-up
  time_waiting_minutes: number; // Speed-to-lead calculation
}
```

### Lead Processing Workflow

#### 1. Concealed Lead Stage
- **Display**: Shows source and submission time only
- **Action**: "Open Lead" button to reveal details
- **Purpose**: Maintain lead confidentiality and track speed-to-lead

#### 2. Lead Opening Process
```typescript
const handleOpenLead = async (leadId: string) => {
  // Record opening timestamp
  // Calculate speed-to-lead metrics
  // Reveal lead details
  // Auto-select for feedback
}
```

#### 3. Lead Details Display
- **Personal Info**: Name, phone, email
- **Inquiry Details**: Group size, preferred time, planned visit
- **Source Context**: Campaign/form information
- **Speed Metrics**: Response time calculation

### Speed-to-Lead Tracking
```typescript
// Automatic calculation on lead opening
speed_to_lead_formatted: string; // "2.3h", "45m", "3d"

// Performance indicators
const getTimeBasedColor = (minutes: number): string => {
  if (minutes <= 10) return "bg-green-50 border-green-200";  // Excellent
  if (minutes <= 20) return "bg-yellow-50 border-yellow-200"; // Good
  return "bg-red-50 border-red-200";  // Needs improvement
}
```

## OB Sales Integration

### Audience Loading
The system integrates with the Customer Outreach system to load selected audiences:

```typescript
const loadSelectedAudience = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/marketing/selected-audience/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  setObAudience(data.customers || []);
  setObAudienceInfo(data);
}
```

### OB Sales Views
```typescript
type OBSalesView = 'dashboard' | 'calling' | 'followups';

// View management
const [obView, setObView] = useState<OBSalesView>('dashboard');
```

#### 1. Dashboard View
- **Performance Metrics**: Speed-to-lead, weekly/monthly averages
- **Call Statistics**: OB calls completed, sales conversions
- **Audience Status**: Current audience size and selection
- **Action Buttons**: Start calling, view follow-ups

#### 2. Calling Interface
- **Customer Display**: Full customer profile with contact information
- **Package History**: Previous packages, activation status, spending
- **Call Form**: Reachability, response, timeline, follow-up requirements
- **Progress Tracking**: Customer index and completion percentage

#### 3. Follow-ups View
- **Follow-up List**: Customers requiring additional contact
- **Call History**: Previous call notes and outcomes
- **Quick Actions**: Direct call links and status updates

### Customer Data Display
```typescript
// Customer information shown during calls
interface CustomerProfile {
  customer_name: string;
  contact_number: string;
  lifetime_spending: number;
  total_bookings: number;
  last_visit_date: string;
  last_package_name: string;
  last_package_type: string;
  active_packages: number;
  last_package_first_use_date: string;
}
```

## Dashboard Analytics

### Performance Metrics
```typescript
interface DashboardStats {
  speedToLead: string;      // Today's average response time
  weekAverage: string;      // Weekly average
  monthAverage: string;     // Monthly average  
  obCalls: number;         // OB calls completed
  sales: number;           // Successful conversions
}
```

### Real-time Updates
- **Speed Calculation**: Automatic on lead opening
- **Call Metrics**: Updated after each call completion
- **Conversion Tracking**: Sales attribution and reporting

## Call Workflow

### New Leads Feedback Form
```typescript
interface FeedbackFormData {
  was_reachable: boolean;
  response_type: 'very_interested' | 'interested_need_time' | 'not_interested' | 'no_clear_answer';
  visit_timeline: 'within_1_week' | 'within_month' | 'no_plan';
  requires_followup: boolean;
  booking_submitted: boolean;
  comments: string;
}
```

### OB Sales Call Form
```typescript
interface OBNotesFormData {
  reachable: 'yes' | 'no' | '';
  response: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'negative' | '';
  timeline: string;
  followUp: 'yes' | 'no' | '';
  notes: string;
}
```

### Form Validation
- **Required Fields**: Reachability status, follow-up requirement
- **Conditional Fields**: Response details only if reachable
- **Notes Requirement**: Detailed call notes for record keeping

### Auto-Advancement
```typescript
// Automatic progression through customer list
const autoAdvanceToNext = () => {
  if (currentIndex < audience.length - 1) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      onIndexChange(currentIndex + 1);
      resetForm();
    }, 1000);
  }
}
```

## Follow-up Management

### Follow-up Creation
- **Automatic**: Based on call outcome responses
- **Manual**: Staff-initiated follow-up requirements
- **Scheduled**: Time-based follow-up scheduling

### Follow-up Tracking
```typescript
const loadFollowUpCustomers = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/marketing/ob-sales-notes?follow_up_required=true&audience_id=${audienceId}`
  );
  setFollowUpCustomers(data.data || []);
}
```

### Follow-up Display
- **Customer Context**: Previous call notes and outcomes
- **Contact Information**: Direct call links
- **Timeline**: Days since last contact
- **Priority**: Based on previous response and value

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Main component structure
export default function LeadFeedbackPage() {
  // State management
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'new-leads' | 'ob-sales'>('new-leads');
  const [leads, setLeads] = useState<Lead[]>([]);
  const [obAudience, setObAudience] = useState<any[]>([]);
  const [currentCustomerIndex, setCurrentCustomerIndex] = useState(0);
  
  // Tab-specific views
  const [obView, setObView] = useState<OBSalesView>('dashboard');
  
  // Form management
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FeedbackFormData>({...});
}
```

## Performance Optimizations (January 2025)

### Backend Performance Improvements
The OB Sales system has been optimized for handling large customer audiences (1000+ customers) with significant performance improvements:

#### 1. Progressive Data Loading
- **Before**: Loading all 1,507 customers at once (17+ seconds, 414 errors)
- **After**: Progressive loading with small batches (10 customers) as needed (<100ms initial load)
- **Implementation**: Sliding window approach with pre-fetching next batch when approaching queue end

#### 2. Separated API Endpoints
- **`/api/customer-outreach/audience/metrics`**: Fast aggregate metrics only (total customers, uncalled count, etc.)
- **`/api/customer-outreach/audience/customers`**: Paginated customer data with offset/limit parameters
- **Benefits**: Eliminates URI length errors, enables progressive loading, improves caching

#### 3. Optimized Database Functions
- **`get_audience_metrics()`**: Returns aggregate data in single query
- **`get_paginated_audience_customers()`**: Efficient pagination with proper indexing
- **`count_called_customers_in_audience()`**: Fast count of customers with existing notes

#### 4. Smart Pre-fetching
- Automatically loads next 10 customers when user reaches last 3 in current batch
- Maintains smooth user experience without loading delays
- Uses background loading to avoid UI blocking

### UI Unchanged
All performance improvements were made at the backend level only:
- **Dashboard**: Identical interface with same metrics display
- **Calling Interface**: Same mobile-optimized form and customer display
- **Follow-ups**: Unchanged user experience
- **Navigation**: Same tab and view switching behavior

### Performance Results
- **Load Time**: 17+ seconds → <100ms (99.5% improvement)
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced from loading 1,500+ records to 10-50 at once
- **Error Elimination**: 414 Request-URI Too Large errors completely resolved
- **User Experience**: Staff can start calling immediately instead of waiting
