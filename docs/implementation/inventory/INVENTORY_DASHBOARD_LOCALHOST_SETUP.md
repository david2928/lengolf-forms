# ðŸš€ Inventory Dashboard - Localhost Setup

## Current Status: Sprint 2 Complete! âœ…

**Dashboard Features Ready:**
- âœ… Beautiful admin inventory dashboard at `/admin/inventory`
- âœ… 4 KPI summary cards (Total Value, Needs Reorder, Low Stock, Sufficient Stock)
- âœ… Product cards grouped by reorder status with color coding
- âœ… Stock progress bars and financial information
- âœ… Edit product modal functionality
- âœ… Responsive design with proper loading states

## ðŸŽ¯ How to View the Dashboard

### Step 1: Database Setup (Required First Time Only)

**You need to run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. **First, run:** `scripts/extend-inventory-products-schema.sql`
   - Adds 3 new columns: `unit_cost`, `image_url`, `purchase_link`

2. **Then, run:** `scripts/create-admin-inventory-functions.sql`  
   - Creates the database functions needed for the dashboard

### Step 2: Start Development Server

The server should already be running from when I started it. If not:

```bash
cd lengolf-forms
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Access the Dashboard

1. **Open:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Sign in** with your Google account (admin user)
3. **Navigate to:** Admin â†’ Inventory (from the top navigation dropdown)
4. **Or go directly to:** http://localhost:3000/admin/inventory

## ðŸŽ¨ What You'll See

### Summary Cards Section
- **Total Inventory Value**: Shows current stock valuation
- **Needs Reorder**: Items below reorder threshold (red)
- **Low Stock**: Items running low (amber)  
- **Sufficient Stock**: Well-stocked items (green)

### Product Cards Section
Products are grouped into 3 sections by status:

#### ðŸ”´ Needs Reorder Section
- Products below reorder threshold
- Red color coding and alert icons
- Prominent placement at top

#### ðŸŸ¡ Low Stock Section  
- Products running low but not critical
- Amber color coding
- Stock progress bars

#### ðŸŸ¢ Sufficient Stock Section
- Products with adequate inventory
- Green color coding
- Healthy stock indicators

### Individual Product Cards Show:
- âœ… Product name and category
- âœ… Current stock level with progress bar
- âœ… Reorder threshold information  
- âœ… Unit cost and total stock value
- âœ… Status badges with color coding
- âœ… Edit button (opens modal for metadata updates)
- âœ… Purchase link button (when available)

## ðŸ”§ If You Get Errors

### "Failed to load inventory data"
- **Cause**: Database functions not yet created
- **Fix**: Run the SQL scripts from Step 1 above

### "Admin access required"  
- **Cause**: User not marked as admin
- **Fix**: In Supabase, update `backoffice.allowed_users` table, set `is_admin = true` for your email

### API Errors
- **Check**: Your Supabase environment variables are set correctly in `.env.local`

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing the Dashboard

1. **View different status groups**: You should see products in different reorder status sections
2. **Try the edit modal**: Click "Edit" on any product card
3. **Test purchase links**: Click the external link button if products have purchase URLs
4. **Check responsive design**: Resize browser to see mobile/tablet layouts
5. **Refresh functionality**: Click the refresh button to reload data
