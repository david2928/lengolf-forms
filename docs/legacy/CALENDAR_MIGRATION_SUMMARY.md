# Calendar Migration and Enhancement Summary

## Initial Problem
User had a react-big-calendar implementation where events were appearing at the bottom instead of at correct time positions. The calendar was supposed to show bookings in bay-based columns with proper time positioning for a golf booking system.

## Root Technical Issues Discovered and Fixed

### Critical Bugs
- **Date conversion problems**: Bangkok timezone ISO strings to JavaScript Date objects causing 3-hour visual offsets
- **Invalid time range**: `max={new Date(2024, 0, 1, 24, 0)}` causing "RangeError: Invalid array length" 
- **Timezone compatibility**: date-fns localizer had timezone handling issues

### Core Technical Fixes
1. **Switched to moment.js localizer** from date-fns for better timezone handling
2. **Fixed date conversion** using `moment(date).startOf('day').hour().minute().second().toDate()` approach
3. **Corrected time range** from invalid hour 24 to `new Date(2024, 0, 1, 23, 59)`
4. **Proper calendar configuration** with correct step/timeslots settings

## Progressive UI Enhancement Requests

### Phase 1: Basic Visual Improvements
- **Removed "pax" from event titles** - show only customer names
- **Implemented bay-based coloring**: Bay 1 (red), Bay 2 (blue), Bay 3 (green)
- **Added resource view** - each bay as separate column
- **Booking type differentiation**:
  - Normal rate (‚è∞): solid colors
  - Coaching (üèåÔ∏è): dashed white border  
  - Package (üì¶): gold border + diagonal stripe pattern
- **Desktop legend** explaining booking type indicators

### Phase 2: Mobile Optimization
- **Single column mobile view** - removed resource columns, no horizontal scrolling
- **Custom day navigation** - prev/next buttons with date display
- **Swipe gesture support** - left/right swipes for day navigation (50px minimum distance)
- **Mobile event layout** - compact format with customer name + booking type icon + bay info
- **Conditional rendering** - separate desktop vs mobile layouts

### Phase 3: Interface Simplification  
User requested: remove package names, remove week view, remove old calendars, single navigation, better space usage

**Removed Components**:
- `ViewToggle.tsx`, `SideBySideView.tsx`, `TraditionalView.tsx`, `useCalendarView.ts`
- Package name display from events
- Week calendar selection (day view only)
- Redundant mobile navigation
- Unused utility functions

**Simplified Navigation**: Single date control, consolidated state management

### Phase 4: Color Changes and Polish
- **Updated bay colors**: Bay 1 blue, Bay 2 red, Bay 3 green
- **Enhanced mobile navigation**: responsive layout, smaller buttons, compact display
- **Added swipe functionality** for mobile/tablet with proper date synchronization  
- **Moved legend to bottom**, removed redundant text
- **Fixed scrolling issues**: proper overflow handling and flex layout

### Phase 5: Functional Improvements
User identified issues: past booking logic, date picker need, phone functionality, modal cleanup

**Past Booking Logic Fix**: Changed from start-time based to end-time based detection (booking 7:30pm-10:30pm at 10pm should remain editable until 10:30pm)

**Date Picker Integration**: 
- Installed `react-day-picker` and `date-fns`
- Clickable date display opens calendar picker using Popover component
- Custom CSS styling to match app theme

**Phone Number Enhancement**:

**Modal Cleanup**:
- Hidden `info@len.golf` emails (always default)
- Removed status display (always "confirmed" for calendar bookings)
- Added booking ID display for past bookings with hash icon
- Made emails clickable `mailto:` links

### Phase 6: EditBookingModal Enhancement & Navigation Integration

**Fixed EditBookingModal Past Booking Logic**:
- Updated past booking detection to use **end-time based logic** (consistent with calendar)
- Fixed error where bookings showed as "past" when they shouldn't be editable
- Replaced start_time + 2 hours logic with proper end_time calculation

**Enhanced EditBookingModal Information Display**:
- **Customer Information Section**: Name, phone, email, people count, booking type, package
- **Clickable Contact Info**: Phone numbers with Thailand formatting, email links
- **Visual Organization**: Clean 2-column grid layout with icons
- **Context-aware Labels**: "Update Notes" vs "Internal Notes" based on existing data
- **Consistent Design**: Matches ViewBookingModal styling and functionality

**Navigation Integration**:
- **Added calendar to Bookings dropdown** in main navigation
- **Updated main homepage** to include "Bookings Calendar" in booking management section
- **Consistent highlighting** - Bookings dropdown highlights when calendar is active
- **Mobile navigation remains unchanged** - calendar already in mobile nav
- **Menu configuration updated** in `src/config/menu-items.ts`
