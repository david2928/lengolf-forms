- Button should link to the new package monitor page

### 2. Package Monitor Page
The page consists of three main sections:

#### A. Diamond Packages Section

- Each package card shows:
  - Customer name
  - Purchase date
  - Expiration date
  - Employee assigned

#### B. Expiring Packages Section
- Grid display of all packages expiring within 7 days
- Visual indicators for urgency:
  - Packages expiring within 2 days
