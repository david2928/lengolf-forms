```
HIGH SECURITY PRIORITY:
- /api/time-clock/punch (public endpoint, PIN-based)
- /api/staff/* (admin-only, staff management)
- /api/admin/photo-management/* (admin-only, file operations)

MEDIUM SECURITY PRIORITY:
- /api/time-clock/entries (admin-only, reporting)
- /api/time-clock/status/* (staff status checking)

LOW SECURITY PRIORITY:
- /api/time-clock/test-photo (development endpoint)
```

**VALIDATION PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:**
- **Comprehensive**: `/api/sales/flexible-analytics`, `/api/dashboard/charts`
- **Partial**: `/api/time-clock/punch`, `/api/staff/route.ts`
- **Minimal**: `/api/admin/photo-management/photos`

**AUTHENTICATION PATTERNS:**
- **Proper Admin Auth**: `/api/staff`, `/api/admin/photo-management`
- **Session-based**: Dashboard and reporting endpoints
- **PIN-based**: `/api/time-clock/punch` (public endpoint)

#### 🎯 SECURITY GAPS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Complete implementation needed for all endpoints
2. **Request Validation**: Standardized schema validation across all APIs
3. **Resource Limits**: Batch size limits and timeout controls
4. **Error Standardization**: Consistent error response format
5. **Debug Code Removal**: Production logging cleanup required

#### 📊 RISK ASSESSMENT:

**HIGH RISK ENDPOINTS:**
- `/api/time-clock/punch` - Public access, no rate limiting
- `/api/admin/photo-management/photos` - Resource intensive operations

**MEDIUM RISK ENDPOINTS:**
- `/api/staff/*` - Admin access with partial validation
- `/api/time-clock/entries` - Recently fixed auth issues

**LOW RISK ENDPOINTS:**
- Development and test endpoints (should be removed from production)

**NEXT PHASE PRIORITY**: Implement rate limiting, standardize validation, and remove debug code

- **Photo API Protection**: 10 requests per minute, 5-minute blocks
- **Smart Authentication**: Successful logins don't count against rate limits
- **Multi-Factor Identification**: IP + User Agent fingerprinting

**2. ✅ ENDPOINT PROTECTION APPLIED:**
- **`/api/time-clock/punch`**: High-security rate limiting with proper headers
- **`/api/staff` (GET/POST)**: Admin endpoint protection implemented
- **`/api/admin/photo-management/photos`**: Resource-intensive operation limits
- **Batch Size Limits**: Photo processing limited to 25 items per request
- **Standard Headers**: `X-RateLimit-*` headers for client awareness

**3. ✅ RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS:**
- **Photo API Batch Limits**: Maximum 25 photos per request (was 50)
- **Memory Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion from large batches
- **Request Size Monitoring**: Logs when limits are applied for security analysis
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages when limits exceeded

**4. ✅ SECURITY HEADERS IMPLEMENTATION:**

- **Retry-After Headers**: Proper retry timing for blocked requests
- **Standard HTTP Status**: 429 (Too Many Requests) with appropriate retry guidance

#### 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

**Rate Limiter Architecture:**
```typescript
// Configurable per-endpoint limits
timeClock: 10 requests/15min, 30min block
staffApi: 100 requests/5min, 10min block  
photoApi: 10 requests/1min, 5min block
```

**Client Identification:**
- Primary: IP address (supports proxy headers)
- Secondary: User Agent fingerprint (first 20 chars)
- Composite: `${ip}:${userAgentHash}` for unique identification

**Memory Management:**

4. **Timezone Issues - Latest Time Entries Not Loading** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: "Today" button and recent entries not loading due to timezone mismatch
   - **Root Cause**: Frontend uses local timezone (US Central) but system expects Bangkok timezone (UTC+7)
   - **Time Difference**: ~12-13 hours between US Central and Bangkok
   - **Solution**: 
     - Updated frontend to use Bangkok timezone for all date filtering
     - Enhanced API endpoint to properly convert between timezones
     - Added debug logging for timezone conversions
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `src/components/admin/time-reports/time-reports-dashboard.tsx` - Bangkok timezone filtering
     - `app/api/time-clock/entries/route.ts` - Proper timezone conversion
   - **Impact**: "Today" button and recent entries now load correctly regardless of user's local timezone

5. **CRITICAL: End-of-Day Timezone Calculation Bug** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: API only capturing first 7 hours of Bangkok day instead of full 24 hours
   - **Root Cause**: End-of-day calculation incorrectly set UTC hours instead of Bangkok hours
   - **Specific Problem**: When filtering for June 19th, system only looked from:
     - Start: `2025-06-18T17:00:00.000Z` (Bangkok midnight)
     - End: `2025-06-18T23:59:59.999Z` (7 AM Bangkok) ❌ 
   - **Impact**: Missing most time entries from current day (7 AM - 11:59 PM Bangkok time)
   - **Solution**: Fixed end-of-day calculation to properly add 24 hours in Bangkok timezone
   - **New Range**: Now correctly captures:
     - Start: `2025-06-18T17:00:00.000Z` (Bangkok midnight)
     - End: `2025-06-19T16:59:59.999Z` (Bangkok 11:59 PM) ✅
   - **Files Modified**: `app/api/time-clock/entries/route.ts` - End date calculation fix
   - **Verification**: Full 24-hour Bangkok day now captured instead of just 7 hours
   - **Status**: RESOLVED - June 19th entries should now appear correctly

6. **Frontend Date Display Timezone Bug** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Time entries showing correct time but wrong date (June 18th instead of June 19th)
   - **Root Cause**: Frontend using `new Date(date_only)` which gets interpreted in local timezone
   - **Specific Problem**: API returns correct Bangkok date "2025-06-19", but `new Date("2025-06-19")` in CST becomes June 18th 6 PM
   - **Impact**: User sees entries with correct time (11:35 PM) but wrong date (Jun 18 instead of Jun 19)
   - **Solution**: Fixed date parsing to explicitly use Bangkok timezone: `new Date(date_only + 'T00:00:00+07:00')`
   - **Files Modified**: `src/components/admin/time-reports/time-reports-dashboard.tsx` - Date display formatting
   - **Verification**: Date display now matches Bangkok timezone consistently
   - **Status**: RESOLVED - Dates now display correctly regardless of user's local timezone

### 🕒 Next Steps:
- Test timezone fix with different user timezones
- Monitor debug logs for proper timezone conversion
- Consider adding timezone display indicators for admin users
