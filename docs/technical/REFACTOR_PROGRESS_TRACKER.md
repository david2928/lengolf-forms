**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025 - Phase 1 COMPLETED ✅  
**Next Action:** Begin Phase 4 - Photo Processing System (Primary bug focus area) 

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### ❌ RESOLVED Issues:
1. **Photo Loading & Modal Issues** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Photos not loading, stuck in loading state
   - **Root Cause**: URL generation issues and server/client hydration mismatch
   - **Solution**: Enhanced URL generation with fallbacks, fixed hydration timing
   - **Files Modified**: 
     - `src/app/admin/time-clock/manage/page.tsx`
     - `src/components/admin/PhotoModal.tsx`
   - **Commit**: `44531e2`

2. **Supabase Admin Fallback Vulnerability** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Dangerous admin fallback that bypassed security checks
   - **Root Cause**: Development shortcut left in production code
   - **Solution**: Removed fallback, enhanced environment validation
   - **Files Modified**: `src/lib/refac-supabase.ts`
   - **Commit**: `54cb283`

3. **Authentication & Security Vulnerabilities** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Missing failed attempt tracking, weak lockout logic, no admin session management
   - **Root Cause**: Incomplete security implementation
   - **Solution**: Enhanced PIN verification, device-based rate limiting, admin session caching
   - **Files Modified**: 
     - `src/lib/staff-utils.ts`
     - `src/lib/auth.ts`
     - `src/lib/auth-config.ts`
     - `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`
   - **Commit**: `19e640c`

4. **Timezone Issues - Latest Time Entries Not Loading** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: "Today" button and recent entries not loading due to timezone mismatch
   - **Root Cause**: Frontend uses local timezone (US Central) but system expects Bangkok timezone (UTC+7)
   - **Time Difference**: ~12-13 hours between US Central and Bangkok
   - **Solution**: 
     - Updated frontend to use Bangkok timezone for all date filtering
     - Enhanced API endpoint to properly convert between timezones
     - Added debug logging for timezone conversions
   - **Files Modified**:
     - `src/components/admin/time-reports/time-reports-dashboard.tsx` - Bangkok timezone filtering
     - `app/api/time-clock/entries/route.ts` - Proper timezone conversion
   - **Impact**: "Today" button and recent entries now load correctly regardless of user's local timezone
   - **Commit**: `150cee8`

5. **CRITICAL: End-of-Day Timezone Calculation Bug** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: API only capturing first 7 hours of Bangkok day instead of full 24 hours
   - **Root Cause**: End-of-day calculation incorrectly set UTC hours instead of Bangkok hours
   - **Specific Problem**: When filtering for June 19th, system only looked from:
     - Start: `2025-06-18T17:00:00.000Z` (Bangkok midnight)
     - End: `2025-06-18T23:59:59.999Z` (7 AM Bangkok) ❌ 
   - **Impact**: Missing most time entries from current day (7 AM - 11:59 PM Bangkok time)
   - **Solution**: Fixed end-of-day calculation to properly add 24 hours in Bangkok timezone
   - **New Range**: Now correctly captures:
     - Start: `2025-06-18T17:00:00.000Z` (Bangkok midnight)
     - End: `2025-06-19T16:59:59.999Z` (Bangkok 11:59 PM) ✅
   - **Files Modified**: `app/api/time-clock/entries/route.ts` - End date calculation fix
   - **Verification**: Full 24-hour Bangkok day now captured instead of just 7 hours
   - **Status**: RESOLVED - June 19th entries should now appear correctly

6. **Frontend Date Display Timezone Bug** - FIXED ✅
   - **Issue**: Time entries showing correct time but wrong date (June 18th instead of June 19th)
   - **Root Cause**: Frontend using `new Date(date_only)` which gets interpreted in local timezone
   - **Specific Problem**: API returns correct Bangkok date "2025-06-19", but `new Date("2025-06-19")` in CST becomes June 18th 6 PM
   - **Impact**: User sees entries with correct time (11:35 PM) but wrong date (Jun 18 instead of Jun 19)
   - **Solution**: Fixed date parsing to explicitly use Bangkok timezone: `new Date(date_only + 'T00:00:00+07:00')`
   - **Files Modified**: `src/components/admin/time-reports/time-reports-dashboard.tsx` - Date display formatting
   - **Verification**: Date display now matches Bangkok timezone consistently
   - **Status**: RESOLVED - Dates now display correctly regardless of user's local timezone

### 🕒 Next Steps:
- Test timezone fix with different user timezones
- Monitor debug logs for proper timezone conversion
- Consider adding timezone display indicators for admin users
