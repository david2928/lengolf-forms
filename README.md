## Core Features & Modules

This application is composed of several key modules that provide its core functionality:

*   **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in using Google accounts with role-based access control, managed via NextAuth.js. Supports binary admin roles (user/admin). (See `app/auth/`, `src/lib/auth-config.ts`)
*   **Enhanced Booking Management**:
    *   **Booking Creation**: A comprehensive form (`app/create-booking/`, `src/components/booking-form/`) with package integration, referral tracking, and new customer detection.
    *   **Booking Management**: Advanced interface (`app/manage-bookings/`) with tabbed edit modal, visual indicators for new customers, and enhanced filtering.
    *   **Booking Editing**: Sophisticated edit capabilities with main information and additional details tabs, supporting partial edits for past bookings.
    *   **Bookings Calendar**: A visual calendar (`app/bookings-calendar/`) displays bookings across different bays, with daily navigation and real-time updates.
    *   **Customer Experience**: Automatic new customer detection, referral source tracking, and visual badges for improved customer service.
    *   **API**: Enhanced backend logic for creating, updating, and retrieving bookings with new fields (`app/api/bookings/`).
*   **Package Management**:
    *   **Package Creation**: A form (`app/create-package/`, `src/components/package-form/`, `src/hooks/usePackageForm.ts`) for creating new customer packages.
    *   **Package Usage**: Functionality to record and update the usage of customer packages (`app/update-package/`, `src/components/package-usage/`).
    *   **Package Monitoring**: A dashboard (`app/package-monitor/`, `src/hooks/use-package-monitor.ts`) to track active "Unlimited" packages and those nearing expiration.
    *   **API**: Endpoints for package data (`app/api/packages/`).
*   **Administrative System**:
    *   **Admin Dashboard**: A dedicated admin section (`app/admin/`) with overview of system management tools and future expansion capabilities.
    *   **Admin Authentication**: Role-based access control with `isUserAdmin()` function and middleware protection.
    *   **Admin Navigation**: Conditional admin menu items in the main navigation for privileged users.
*   **Customer Data Management**:
    *   **CRM Integration**: An API endpoint (`app/api/crm/update-customers/`) triggers a Google Cloud Run service to refresh customer data.
    *   **Data Hooks**: Custom hooks (`src/hooks/useCustomers.ts`, `src/hooks/use-customers.ts`) for fetching customer lists.
*   **Notifications**: Integration with LINE Messaging API (`src/lib/line-messaging.ts`) for sending real-time notifications, likely triggered via API routes in `app/api/notify/`.
*   **Google Services Integration**:
    *   **Google Calendar**: Synchronization for bookings (`src/lib/google-calendar.ts`).
    *   **Google Sheets**: Potential data exchange with Google Sheets (`src/lib/google-sheets-service.ts`).

## Recent Changes

### Booking System Bug Fixes and Enhancements (January 2025)

Fixed critical issues in the booking management system to improve data accuracy and user experience:

**Bugs Fixed:**
- **LINE Notification Duration Bug**: Fixed incorrect duration change notifications when only editing other fields (e.g., referral source). The system was incorrectly showing "Duration: 60h ‚Üí 1h" due to unit conversion mismatches between frontend (minutes) and database (hours).

**Technical Improvements:**
- **Proper Unit Conversion**: Implemented consistent duration handling throughout the system, ensuring proper conversion between minutes (frontend) and hours (database)
- **Smart Change Detection**: Enhanced the booking update API to only update fields that actually changed, preventing false change notifications
- **Real-time Bay Availability**: Edit modal now fetches actual availability for all bays on open, allowing users to see which bays are available for switching
