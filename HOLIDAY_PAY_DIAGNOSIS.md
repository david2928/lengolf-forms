# Holiday Pay Diagnosis for May 2025

## Issue: Holiday pay showing as 0 for all employees in May 2025

## Step-by-Step Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check if holidays exist in database âœ… **START HERE**

1. **Go to Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to: Admin â†’ Payroll Dashboard
   - Click on the **"Holidays"** tab

2. **Check for May 2025 holidays**
   - Look for these dates in the holidays list:
     - `2025-05-01` - Labour Day
     - `2025-05-04` - Coronation Day  
     - `2025-05-12` - Visakha Bucha Day

3. **If holidays are missing:**
   - Click **"Load Default Holidays"** button
   - This will add all 2025 holidays including May dates
   - âœ… This is the most likely fix!

### Step 2: Check if staff worked on holiday dates

1. **Go to Admin â†’ Time Reports**
   - Filter for May 2025
   - Check if any staff have time entries on:
     - May 1, 2025 (Labour Day)
     - May 4, 2025 (Coronation Day)
     - May 12, 2025 (Visakha Bucha Day)

2. **If no one worked on holidays:**
   - âœ… This explains zero holiday pay - it's correct!
   - Holiday pay only applies to hours actually worked on holiday dates

### Step 3: Check staff compensation settings

1. **Go to Admin â†’ Payroll Dashboard â†’ Service Charge tab**
   - Or check if there's a staff compensation section
   - Verify staff have `holiday_rate_per_hour` set (not 0)

2. **Expected rates:**
   - Should be something like à¸¿100-150/hour for holiday premium
   - If rates are 0, no holiday pay will be calculated

### Step 4: Verify the calculation logic

**How holiday pay works:**
1. System finds all holidays in the month (from `public_holidays` table)
2. Gets all staff time entries for the month
3. Groups time entries by staff and date using: `entryDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]`
4. Checks if any daily dates match holiday dates exactly
5. Calculates: `holiday_hours Ã— holiday_rate_per_hour = holiday_pay`

**Date format must match exactly:**
- Holiday dates stored as: `"2025-05-01"`
- Time entry dates formatted as: `"2025-05-01"` (UTC date)

## Most Likely Solutions

### Solution 1: Load Missing Holidays (90% chance this fixes it)
```
1. Admin â†’ Payroll â†’ Holidays tab
2. Click "Load Default Holidays"  
3. Verify May 2025 holidays are now listed
4. Go back to Payroll Overview â†’ May 2025
5. Holiday pay should now calculate correctly
```

### Solution 2: No Staff Worked on Holidays (Expected behavior)
```
If no staff actually worked on May 1, 4, or 12, 2025:
- Holiday pay = 0 is CORRECT
- Only staff who work on actual holiday dates get holiday pay
```

### Solution 3: Missing Compensation Settings
```
1. Check staff compensation settings
2. Ensure holiday_rate_per_hour > 0
3. Verify effective dates cover May 2025
```

## Technical Details

**Holiday Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
// 1. Get holidays for month
const holidays = await getHolidays('2025-05');  // May 1, 4, 12

// 2. Get daily hours for all staff
const dailyHours = await calculateDailyHours('2025-05');

// 3. Match dates
for (const daily of dailyHours) {
  if (holidayDates.has(daily.date)) {  // e.g., "2025-05-01"
    holidayHours += daily.total_hours;
  }
}

// 4. Calculate pay
const holidayPay = holidayHours * staff.holiday_rate_per_hour;
```

**Critical:** Date formats must match exactly between holidays table and time entries processing.

## Next Steps

1. **First** - Load default holidays using admin panel
2. **Then** - Check if anyone actually worked on May 1, 4, or 12
3. **Finally** - Verify staff have holiday rates configured

The most common cause is missing holidays in the database! ðŸŽ¯
